Agile methodology is a philosophy and a set of principles designed to foster a more responsive and adaptable way of working compared to traditional, linear "waterfall" approaches. Instead of defining all requirements and planning the entire project upfront, Agile breaks down projects into smaller, manageable iterations or sprints. Each sprint involves planning, development, testing, and review, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments. This iterative nature enables teams to respond quickly to changing requirements, market demands, or new insights, ensuring the final product aligns with evolving needs. Collaboration is a cornerstone, with close interaction between cross-functional teams and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. The focus is on delivering working software or tangible value frequently, rather than waiting for a single large delivery at the end.

For example, in developing a mobile application, an Agile team might work in two-week sprints. In the first sprint, they might focus on building the core user authentication and profile creation features. At the end of the sprint, they present a working version of these features to stakeholders for feedback. Based on this feedback, the team can then adjust their plan for the next sprint, perhaps prioritizing a specific enhancement to the profile or addressing a usability issue identified. This contrasts with a waterfall approach where all features would be designed and developed before any part is shown to the customer.

Agile is widely adopted across various industries, particularly in software development, but its principles are increasingly being applied to marketing, HR, and other business functions. Its primary benefit is the ability to deliver high-quality, relevant products more efficiently by embracing change and fostering continuous improvement.
