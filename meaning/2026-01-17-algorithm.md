An algorithm outlines a clear sequence of actions that, when followed precisely, will lead to a predictable outcome. It breaks down a complex process into smaller, manageable steps. Think of it as a recipe for a computer or a method for a human to achieve a desired result.

For instance, a sorting algorithm would provide instructions on how to arrange a list of numbers from smallest to largest.

This term is extensively used in computer science, mathematics, and engineering, forming the backbone of software development and data processing.
