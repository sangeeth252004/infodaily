When you type a website address, like `www.example.com`, into your web browser, your computer needs to know the specific numerical address (IP address) of the server hosting that website to connect to it. The Domain Name System (DNS) acts as the internet's phonebook, looking up the corresponding IP address for the domain name you entered. This process allows users to navigate the internet using easy-to-remember names instead of complex numbers.

For instance, when you visit `www.google.com`, DNS translates this domain name into an IP address such as `172.217.160.142`, enabling your browser to load the Google homepage.

DNS is fundamental to nearly all internet operations and is commonly used by web browsers, email clients, and other internet-connected applications.
