### Functionality

This system acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. It examines data packets and determines whether to allow them to pass or block them based on a set of defined policies. These policies can be configured to permit or deny traffic based on various criteria, including source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and application protocols.

### Operation

By analyzing traffic, a firewall can prevent unauthorized access to a private network and protect it from malicious software and other cyber threats. It essentially acts as a gatekeeper, enforcing security boundaries.

### Example

An example of a firewall's action would be blocking an attempt to connect to a company server from an unknown IP address.

### Common Usage

Firewalls are a fundamental component of network security, commonly found in both home and enterprise environments to safeguard data and systems.
