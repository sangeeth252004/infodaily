It consists of interconnected processing units, often called nodes or neurons, organized in layers. These nodes receive input, perform simple computations, and transmit output to other nodes. The strength of the connections between nodes, known as weights, can be adjusted during a learning process. This adjustment allows the network to identify patterns and relationships within data.

For instance, a neural network can be trained to recognize handwritten digits by processing images and adjusting its internal connections until it accurately classifies them.

Neural networks are commonly utilized in fields such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and data analysis for tasks like prediction, classification, and pattern recognition.
