Phishing attacks leverage social engineering tactics, often through email, instant messaging, or fake websites, to create a sense of urgency or trust in the victim. The attacker masquerades as a well-known and reputable organization, such as a bank, social media platform, government agency, or even a colleague, to make their fraudulent communication appear authentic. Common objectives include obtaining personal details like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or financial account information. Victims are typically prompted to click on malicious links, download infected attachments, or directly reply with their sensitive data, often under the guise of verifying account information, claiming a prize, or resolving a critical issue.

For example, a victim might receive an email that appears to be from their bank, stating that their account has been compromised and they need to click a provided link to verify their identity. This link, however, leads to a fake login page designed to steal the victim's credentials when entered. The context is crucial; phishing attacks exploit human psychology, preying on fear, greed, or a desire to be helpful, making them a persistent threat across both personal and professional environments.
