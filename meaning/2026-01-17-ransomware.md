This digital threat operates by preventing authorized users from accessing their data or computer functions. Once installed, the software typically displays a message indicating that a ransom must be paid, often in cryptocurrency, to receive the decryption key or unlock the system. The perpetrators may threaten to permanently delete the data or release sensitive information if the ransom is not met.

For instance, a company discovered their entire customer database had been encrypted and a ransom note appeared on their servers.
