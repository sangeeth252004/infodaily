SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a multifaceted discipline focused on increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to a website through organic search engine results. It involves a combination of on-page, off-page, and technical strategies designed to make a website more attractive to search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. On-page SEO includes optimizing elements directly on the website, such as keywords in content, meta descriptions, title tags, and image alt text. Off-page SEO primarily involves building backlinks from other reputable websites, social media engagement, and online reputation management. Technical SEO addresses the website's infrastructure, ensuring it's crawlable, indexable, fast-loading, mobile-friendly, and secure (e.g., via HTTPS). The ultimate goal of SEO is to drive targeted traffic that is more likely to convert into customers or achieve other desired business outcomes.

For example, if a user searches for "best vegan restaurants in London," a well-optimized website for a vegan restaurant in London would likely appear higher in the search results than one with poor SEO. This could be achieved by using relevant keywords like "vegan restaurant London," "plant-based dining," and specific neighborhood names within their website's content and meta tags, ensuring the site loads quickly on mobile devices, and obtaining links from local food blogs or review sites.

In essence, SEO aims to make a website discoverable and trustworthy in the eyes of both search engines and users.
