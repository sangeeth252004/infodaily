Think of a domain name as the name of a house on a street. Instead of remembering a complex numerical address (like an IP address, which is the internet's version of street numbers and zip codes), you use a name that's easier for people to recall and type. This name points to a specific server or location online where a website, email service, or other internet-based resource resides.

For example, the domain name "example.com" is much simpler to remember than the numerical IP address it represents.

Domain names are fundamental to the functioning of the World Wide Web, online businesses, and digital communication.
