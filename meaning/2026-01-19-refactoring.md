Refactoring involves making internal improvements to software code. The primary goal is to enhance clarity, reduce complexity, and improve maintainability. This is achieved by systematically altering the code's structure, for example, by breaking down large functions into smaller ones, renaming variables for better understanding, or reorganizing class hierarchies. Crucially, these changes are made incrementally, with thorough testing at each stage to ensure that the program's functionality remains identical from an end-user's perspective.

For instance, a developer might refactor a long, complicated method by extracting parts of its logic into separate, well-named helper methods.

This practice is fundamental in software development, particularly within agile methodologies, and is essential for long-term project health.
