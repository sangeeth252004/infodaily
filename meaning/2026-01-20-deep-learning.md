Deep learning models are structured like layers of interconnected nodes, often referred to as neurons, similar to the human brain. Each layer processes information from the previous layer and passes a more refined version to the next. This layered approach allows the model to automatically discover intricate patterns and representations within complex datasets.

For instance, a deep learning system can learn to identify objects in images by progressively identifying edges, then shapes, and finally complete objects across its many layers.

This field is commonly applied in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech synthesis, and recommendation systems.
