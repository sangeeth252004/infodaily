This approach modifies the presentation of educational material and the sequence of activities based on a learner's performance and inferred understanding. Systems using adaptive learning analyze a student's responses to questions, identify areas of strength and weakness, and then adjust the difficulty, content, or pace of instruction accordingly. For instance, if a student consistently answers questions about a particular mathematical concept correctly, the system might present more challenging problems or move on to the next topic. Conversely, if a student struggles, the system may offer additional explanations, simpler exercises, or review prerequisite material.

Example: An online math platform uses adaptive learning to provide personalized practice problems for students struggling with fractions, offering more detailed explanations and simpler examples until mastery is demonstrated.

This methodology is frequently encountered in digital educational software, online courses, and personalized tutoring systems. It is also explored in training programs and skill development platforms where individual progress tracking is crucial.
