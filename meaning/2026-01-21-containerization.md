This approach isolates applications and their required libraries, configuration files, and runtime environments from the underlying infrastructure, ensuring consistency across different computing environments. Each container runs as an independent process, sharing the host operating system's kernel but maintaining its own isolated filesystem, network, and process space. This isolation prevents conflicts between applications and simplifies deployment, management, and scaling.

For example, a web application and its database can each be deployed in separate containers, allowing them to be updated or scaled independently without affecting each other.

Containerization is widely employed in software development, cloud computing, and DevOps practices, particularly with technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.
