This approach aims to break down the silos that traditionally exist between development teams, who build software, and operations teams, who manage and maintain it. By fostering collaboration and communication, DevOps seeks to streamline the entire process of software creation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. This leads to faster release cycles, more reliable software, and the ability to respond quickly to changes and user feedback.

For example, a team might implement continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines as part of their DevOps strategy.

DevOps principles are commonly applied in technology companies, software development firms, and organizations that prioritize agile methodologies and rapid innovation.
