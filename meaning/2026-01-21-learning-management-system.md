An LMS provides a centralized platform for managing educational content and user progress. It allows instructors to upload course materials such as documents, videos, and quizzes, and enables learners to access these resources, complete assignments, and track their performance. The system can also facilitate communication between instructors and learners through forums or messaging features.

For instance, a company might use an LMS to onboard new employees by assigning them a series of training modules.

This technology is commonly employed in educational institutions, corporate training departments, and online learning environments.
