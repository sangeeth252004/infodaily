This process involves presenting two variations, labeled 'A' and 'B', to different segments of an audience simultaneously. The goal is to observe how each variation impacts a specific outcome, such as user engagement, conversion rates, or click-through rates. By measuring the results for each group, one can statistically analyze which version achieved the desired objective more effectively.

For example, a website designer might test two different button colors to see which one leads to more clicks.

A/B testing is frequently employed in fields such as digital marketing, web design, software development, and user experience research to optimize various aspects of products and services.
