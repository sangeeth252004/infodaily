This technique involves sending messages, often via email or text, that appear to originate from a legitimate source like a bank, social media platform, or government agency. The sender's goal is to trick the recipient into revealing personal details such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or social security numbers. These communications frequently employ urgency or threats to compel immediate action, such as clicking a malicious link or downloading an infected attachment. The information obtained is then used for fraudulent purposes, like identity theft or financial gain.

*Example:* "The email claiming to be from her bank, asking her to update her account details, turned out to be a phishing attempt."

This term is commonly used in discussions related to cybersecurity, online safety, and fraud prevention.
