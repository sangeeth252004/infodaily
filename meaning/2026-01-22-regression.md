This analytical technique aims to establish a mathematical equation that best describes how changes in the independent variables correspond to changes in the dependent variable. By fitting a curve or line to a set of data points, the method seeks to minimize the difference between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the model. The resulting equation can then be utilized for forecasting, prediction, or to simply understand the strength and direction of the associations between variables. For example, one might use regression analysis to predict a student's test score based on their study hours and previous grades. This technique is widely applied across various fields, including statistics, machine learning, economics, finance, and the social sciences, for tasks such as trend analysis, risk assessment, and causal inference.
