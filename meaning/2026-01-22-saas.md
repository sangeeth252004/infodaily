Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual computers, users access it remotely through a web browser or dedicated application. The provider manages the underlying infrastructure, maintenance, and updates, allowing users to focus on utilizing the software. This model typically involves recurring payments, such as monthly or annual fees.

For instance, a company might subscribe to a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) SaaS to manage its sales interactions.

SaaS is widely adopted by businesses of all sizes, particularly for tools like email, office productivity suites, and specialized business management applications.
