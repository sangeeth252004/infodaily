In this model, developers write and deploy code without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider automatically runs the code in response to events and scales it up or down as necessary. This means organizations do not need to provision or maintain servers, freeing up resources for other tasks. Payment is typically based on the actual compute time consumed, rather than on pre-purchased server capacity.

For example, a web application could use serverless functions to handle user authentication, scaling automatically during peak traffic.

This approach is commonly employed in cloud-native application development, microservices architectures, and event-driven systems.
