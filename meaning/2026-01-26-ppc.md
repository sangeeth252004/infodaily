In this advertising system, a business pays a publisher (often a search engine or website owner) a sum of money whenever their advertisement is clicked. The cost for each click is determined by a bidding process among advertisers. Advertisers bid on keywords or target audiences relevant to their products or services. When a user performs a search or visits a website and their query or browsing aligns with an advertiser's bid, the advertiser's ad may be displayed. If the user then clicks on that ad, the advertiser incurs a cost.

For example, a local bakery might run a PPC campaign targeting searches for "custom birthday cakes near me," paying a small amount each time someone clicks their advertisement to visit their website.

This method of advertising is widely employed on search engines like Google and Bing, as well as on social media platforms and other websites that offer advertising space.
