*   **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** is a standardized string of characters that specifies the location of a resource, such as a web page, image, or file, and the protocol needed to retrieve it. Think of it as the mailing address for something on the internet.

*   It typically includes several components: the **scheme** (like `http` or `https` for web pages), a **domain name** (like `www.example.com`), and sometimes a **path** to a specific file or page (like `/about-us`).

*   **Example:** `https://www.example.com/products/item123` is a URL that points to a specific product page on the example.com website.

*   URLs are fundamental to navigating the World Wide Web and are commonly encountered when browsing websites, sending links, or accessing online content.
