These programs are trained on massive amounts of text and code from the internet and other sources. This extensive training allows them to learn patterns, grammar, facts, and various writing styles. LLMs can perform a wide range of language-related tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing information, translating languages, and creating different forms of creative content.

For instance, a user might ask an LLM to "Explain the process of photosynthesis in simple terms."

LLMs are commonly found in applications related to natural language processing, content creation tools, virtual assistants, and research platforms.
