This methodology focuses on understanding user behavior on a digital platform and implementing data-driven changes to enhance their experience and guide them toward specific goals. Practitioners analyze various elements, including website layout, content, calls to action, and user flow, to identify areas of friction or opportunity. The objective is to achieve a higher number of conversions—such as sales, form submissions, subscriptions, or downloads—from the existing traffic, rather than solely investing in acquiring more visitors.

For example, applying conversion rate optimization strategies helped an online service provider increase its free trial sign-up rate by improving the landing page design. This approach is commonly employed in fields like digital marketing, e-commerce, user experience (UX) design, and product management, where maximizing online performance and efficiency are key.
