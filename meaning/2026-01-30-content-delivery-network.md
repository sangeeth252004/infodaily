A CDN operates by caching copies of website assets, such as images, videos, and code, on numerous servers situated in various geographical locations around the world. When a user requests content from a website that utilizes a CDN, the request is routed to the server closest to them. This proximity significantly reduces the distance data must travel, resulting in faster loading times and a more responsive user experience.

For instance, a popular online news site uses a CDN to ensure articles and images load quickly for readers globally.

This technology is commonly employed by websites that experience high traffic volumes, serve a geographically dispersed audience, or host large media files.
