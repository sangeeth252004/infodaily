An MVP represents the core set of features necessary to solve a primary problem for a target audience. It is built with the minimum effort and resources required, prioritizing essential functionality over extensive polish or a full suite of capabilities. The primary goal of releasing an MVP is to test fundamental assumptions about the product, market demand, and user needs through real-world interaction. Feedback collected from early users informs subsequent development, allowing for iterative improvements and feature additions based on actual market reception.

For example, a software company might release an MVP of a task management application with only basic task creation, assignment, and completion features.

This term is frequently encountered in the fields of product development, software engineering, and startup methodologies, particularly within agile frameworks.
