*   **What it is:** Imagine a software program has a hidden flaw, like a secret unlocked door, that its creators are completely unaware of. A zero-day exploit is the method or tool a malicious actor uses to sneak through that unlocked door before anyone knows it exists. The "zero-day" refers to the fact that the software vendor has had zero days to fix the problem once the exploit is discovered or used.

*   **How it works:** Attackers discover these vulnerabilities through various means, often through extensive analysis of software code. Once a vulnerability is found, they can develop code that takes advantage of it to gain unauthorized access, steal data, disrupt services, or install malicious software. Because there is no readily available fix, systems remain vulnerable until the vendor can develop and distribute a patch.

*   **Example:** A cybercriminal might use a zero-day exploit to gain remote control of a user's computer by tricking them into opening a malicious email attachment, which then activates the exploit.

*   **Context:** This term is frequently encountered in cybersecurity discussions, particularly when referring to advanced persistent threats (APTs), sophisticated malware campaigns, and the ongoing struggle to maintain system security against constantly evolving threats. Security researchers and vendors also use the term when discussing newly discovered vulnerabilities.
