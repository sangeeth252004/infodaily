A data lake acts as a large storage system designed to hold a significant volume of diverse information. Unlike traditional databases that require data to be structured before storage, a data lake accepts data in its original, unprocessed state. This includes structured data (like tables), semi-structured data (like XML or JSON files), and unstructured data (like images, audio, or plain text).

The primary advantage is flexibility; data can be ingested without predefined schemas, allowing for later analysis and exploration. This approach enables organizations to discover patterns and insights that might be missed with pre-structured data. For instance, a company might store all its customer interaction logs, website clickstream data, and social media feeds in a data lake.

This term is commonly used within the fields of big data management, cloud computing, and business intelligence.
