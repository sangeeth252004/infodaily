term: "Overfitting"
definition: "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data."

<p>When a statistical model or machine learning algorithm is developed, it is typically trained on a set of data. This training process aims to identify patterns and relationships within that data. Overfitting happens when the model becomes excessively complex, capturing not only the genuine underlying patterns but also the random fluctuations or errors present in the specific training dataset. This excessive focus on the training data prevents the model from generalizing effectively to data it has not encountered before.</p>

<p>Consequently, an overfitted model will perform exceptionally well on the data it was trained on, but its predictive accuracy will significantly degrade when applied to new, independent observations. Think of it like memorizing the answers to a specific practice test without understanding the concepts; you'd do great on that test, but likely fail a slightly different one.</p>

<p>For instance, a machine learning model trained to identify images of cats might learn to associate specific background elements unique to its training photos, rather than solely focusing on the features of the cats themselves.</p>

<p>This term is commonly encountered in the fields of machine learning, statistical modeling, and predictive analytics.</p>
