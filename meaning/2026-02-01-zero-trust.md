This approach assumes that threats can originate from both outside and inside a network, meaning no user or device is automatically trusted, regardless of their location. Every access request must be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before access is granted. This involves strict identity verification, least privilege access, and micro-segmentation of networks to limit the lateral movement of potential attackers.

For example, an employee requesting access to a sensitive file from their work laptop would still undergo authentication and authorization checks.

The concept of Zero Trust is widely adopted in cybersecurity strategies for protecting sensitive data and critical infrastructure in corporate and government environments.
