Unlike classical computers that store information as bits representing either 0 or 1, quantum computers utilize quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously, allowing for a vast increase in the amount of information that can be processed. Furthermore, quantum phenomena such as entanglement enable qubits to be interconnected in a way that their states are correlated, even when separated. This allows quantum computers to explore a multitude of possibilities concurrently, leading to potentially exponential speedups for certain types of problems.

For example, a quantum computer could efficiently search through a massive database for a specific item.

This technology is frequently discussed in fields such as scientific research, cryptography, and materials science.
