In a serverless model, developers write and deploy code without needing to provision, manage, or scale servers themselves. The cloud provider automatically allocates and manages the necessary computing resources in response to specific events or requests. This means developers focus solely on their application logic, while the underlying infrastructure is handled by the service provider.

For instance, a developer might write a function that processes uploaded images. When a new image is uploaded, the serverless platform automatically runs that function to perform the necessary operations.

This approach is widely adopted in cloud computing for building applications, particularly for tasks that are event-driven or have variable workloads.
