Unit testing is a software development practice where individual components or "units" of a program are tested in isolation. A unit is typically the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class. The purpose is to validate that each unit behaves as intended before integrating it with other parts of the system. This process helps identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, making the overall software more robust and easier to maintain.

For instance, if a function is designed to add two numbers, a unit test would provide various inputs (e.g., positive numbers, negative numbers, zero) and assert that the output matches the expected sum.

This practice is fundamental in software engineering, particularly in agile development methodologies and within the broader scope of quality assurance and software development lifecycle management.
