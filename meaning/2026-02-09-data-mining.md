This involves using specialized techniques and algorithms to sift through vast amounts of collected data. The goal is to identify trends, relationships, and anomalies that might not be obvious through simple observation. By analyzing this information, organizations can gain insights to make better decisions or predict future outcomes.

For instance, a retail company might use data mining to understand customer purchasing habits.

This practice is frequently employed in fields such as business intelligence, scientific research, and marketing.
