Think of metadata as descriptive labels for a piece of information. It doesn't contain the actual content, but rather details about that content, such as its creation date, author, format, or size. This information helps to organize, find, and understand the primary data.

For example, a photograph has metadata including the date it was taken, the camera model used, and the location where it was captured.

This concept is frequently encountered in digital file management, databases, libraries, and web technologies, where it facilitates search, retrieval, and cataloging.
