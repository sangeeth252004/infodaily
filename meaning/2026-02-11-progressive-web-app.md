This means that a PWA can function similarly to a native application installed on a device, even though it is accessed through a web browser. PWAs are built using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

They are designed to be responsive, working on any device, regardless of screen size. Features such as offline access, push notifications, and the ability to be added to a device's home screen are key characteristics that distinguish PWAs from traditional websites. This provides a more seamless and engaging user experience.

For example, many news websites now offer a PWA version, allowing users to read articles even without an internet connection.

The term Progressive Web App is commonly used in web development and technology discussions, particularly when discussing mobile web strategies and enhancing user engagement for online services.
