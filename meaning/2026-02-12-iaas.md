IaaS delivers IT infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking, on a pay-as-you-go basis. Instead of purchasing and managing physical hardware, users rent these resources from a cloud provider. This allows organizations to scale their IT capabilities up or down based on demand without the need for upfront capital investment in hardware.

For example, a company might use IaaS to quickly deploy a new web application without buying new servers.

This service model is prevalent in business and technology sectors, particularly for web hosting, application development, data storage, and disaster recovery solutions.
