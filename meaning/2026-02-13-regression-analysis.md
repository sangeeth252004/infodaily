This technique helps researchers understand how changes in certain factors (independent variables) can influence or predict changes in another factor (dependent variable). It works by fitting a mathematical model to observed data, allowing for the quantification of the strength and direction of these relationships.

For instance, a study might use regression analysis to determine how the number of hours a student studies affects their exam score.

Regression analysis is frequently employed in fields such as economics, finance, medicine, social sciences, and engineering for tasks like forecasting, modeling trends, and identifying causal links.
