This area involves equipping machines with the ability to process and analyze text and spoken words in a way that mimics human comprehension. It tackles the complexities of grammar, meaning, and intent within human communication.

For instance, NLP powers systems that can translate entire paragraphs from one language to another.

NLP is frequently encountered in applications such as virtual assistants, search engines, sentiment analysis tools, and automated customer service.
