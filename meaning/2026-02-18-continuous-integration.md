This practice involves automating the build and testing of code whenever new changes are committed. The goal is to detect integration issues early in the development cycle, making it easier and less costly to resolve them. By integrating code changes often, teams can improve the quality of their software and reduce the risk of late-stage bugs.

For instance, a developer might commit a small feature update, and the system automatically compiles the code and runs a suite of tests to ensure it works with the rest of the project.

This approach is a core tenet of agile development methodologies and is widely adopted in modern software engineering workflows.
