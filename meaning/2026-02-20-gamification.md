This approach aims to engage individuals and motivate them to achieve specific goals by borrowing features commonly found in games. These features can include points, badges, leaderboards, challenges, and rewards, which are integrated into activities that would otherwise not be considered games. The intention is to make tasks more enjoyable, foster competition, or encourage participation and learning.

For instance, a language learning app might award users points for completing lessons and unlock new levels as they progress.

This strategy is frequently employed in areas such as education, marketing, employee training, health and fitness applications, and customer loyalty programs.
