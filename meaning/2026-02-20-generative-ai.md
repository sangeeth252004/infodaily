These systems learn patterns and structures from existing data, such as text, images, or audio, and then use this understanding to create new outputs that resemble the training data but are not direct copies. This creation process involves predicting what should come next in a sequence or assembling components in a way that forms something original.

For instance, a generative AI could compose a poem based on a given theme and style.

This technology is frequently encountered in fields like creative arts, software development, scientific research, and marketing.
