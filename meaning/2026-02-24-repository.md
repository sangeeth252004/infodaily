A repository serves as a central location designed to hold and organize various types of data, documents, or objects. Its primary function is to ensure that these stored elements are preserved, organized, and readily available when needed. The contents are typically cataloged or indexed to facilitate efficient retrieval.

For instance, a digital repository might house a collection of scientific research papers.

This term is commonly used in contexts such as software development, data management, archival science, and library science.
