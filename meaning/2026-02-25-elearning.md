This form of learning utilizes digital devices and the internet to provide educational content and facilitate the learning process. It encompasses a wide range of formats, including online courses, virtual classrooms, interactive modules, and digital educational resources. Learners can access materials, participate in discussions, and complete assignments remotely, often at their own pace.

For instance, a student might complete a university course entirely through an online platform, accessing lectures and submitting assignments digitally.

eLearning is commonly employed in academic institutions, corporate training programs, and professional development initiatives.
