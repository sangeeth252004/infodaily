A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw that can be exploited by malicious actors before the software or hardware developer becomes aware of its existence. This means that no patch or fix is available at the time of discovery, leaving systems unprotected. Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt operations. The term "zero-day" signifies that the developers have had zero days to address the issue.

For example, a cybercriminal might discover a way to exploit a flaw in a popular web browser before the browser's company knows about it. This vulnerability is then referred to as a zero-day.

This term is commonly used in cybersecurity, vulnerability research, and threat intelligence circles.
