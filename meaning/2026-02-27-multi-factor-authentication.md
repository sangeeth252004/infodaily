This method enhances security by adding multiple layers of verification beyond a single password. It typically combines authentication factors from at least two of three broad categories: something the user *knows* (like a password or PIN), something the user *has* (such as a smartphone, smart card, or security token), or something the user *is* (biometric data like a fingerprint or facial scan). If one factor is compromised, unauthorized access is still prevented because the additional, independent factors are required.

For instance, when logging into an online banking portal, a user might enter their password (something they know) and then approve the login request through a notification on their registered mobile device (something they have). This security measure is widely adopted across various digital services, including online banking, email platforms, cloud storage, social media, and corporate networks, to protect sensitive data and user accounts from unauthorized access.
