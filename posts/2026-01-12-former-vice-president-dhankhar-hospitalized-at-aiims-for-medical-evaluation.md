Former Vice President Dhankhar has been admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi for medical evaluation. The hospitalization follows reports that Mr. Dhankhar experienced two separate fainting episodes during the past week. Medical professionals at AIIMS are preparing to conduct a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan as part of a comprehensive diagnostic assessment.

Mr. Dhankhar, identified as a former Vice President, holds a significant position in the public sphere. His admission to AIIMS, one of India's most prestigious medical institutions known for its advanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities, underscores the attention being given to his health. Such a move is standard for prominent public figures requiring specialized medical attention.

The reported fainting incidents last week were the direct precursor to his current medical admission. Fainting, clinically termed syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness usually caused by a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain. While often benign, recurrent episodes can sometimes indicate underlying health issues that require thorough investigation. The medical team's immediate course of action involves detailed diagnostic tests to identify the precise cause.

The upcoming MRI scan is a critical component of this diagnostic process. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging technology that utilizes a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to generate highly detailed images of organs, soft tissues, bone, and virtually all other internal body structures. This advanced imaging technique can provide valuable insights into the condition of the brain, heart, blood vessels, and other areas, aiding clinicians in diagnosing neurological, cardiac, or other systemic issues that might contribute to fainting spells.

Key details regarding the admission include:
*   **Individual Admitted:** Dhankhar, identified as a former Vice President.
*   **Medical Facility:** All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), located in New Delhi.
*   **Reported Symptoms:** Two episodes of fainting observed during the previous week.
*   **Planned Diagnostic Procedure:** A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is scheduled.
*   **AIIMS's Role:** The institution is a leading government-funded public medical research university and hospital, recognized for its advanced healthcare facilities and specialized medical expertise.

Medical professionals at AIIMS are continuing their diagnostic work-up. The results from the scheduled MRI scan are crucial for understanding the cause of Mr. Dhankhar's symptoms and guiding subsequent medical decisions. No official medical bulletin or statement regarding his current condition or expected discharge has been publicly released at this time. Further updates are anticipated as the medical team completes its assessment.
