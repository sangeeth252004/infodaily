A parliamentary panel has sharply criticized universities and other higher education institutions across India for routinely rejecting experienced Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) teachers for full-time positions, often citing the reason "not found suitable." The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment, in a report tabled in Parliament in April 2022, expressed strong disapproval of these practices, highlighting concerns about the effective implementation of reservation policies.

The committee noted a pattern where eligible and experienced SC/ST educators, some of whom were already serving as ad-hoc or guest lecturers, were being overlooked for permanent roles. This systematic rejection, according to the panel, suggests a lack of commitment to constitutional provisions for reservations and potentially indicates deeper systemic issues within the recruitment process of higher education institutions. The report underscored that such rejections not only undermine the careers of qualified individuals but also hinder the efforts to achieve diverse and inclusive faculty representation in academic settings.

The panel's observations indicate that the reasons provided for deeming candidates "not suitable" often lacked specific justification, appearing to be a standardized response rather than a merit-based assessment. This approach, the committee stated, defeats the spirit of the reservation policy, which aims to ensure equitable representation for marginalized communities in public employment, including academic positions.

Key findings and recommendations from the parliamentary panel include:

*   **Routine Rejections:** The committee observed that rejections for experienced SC/ST teachers were often communicated in a "casual and routine manner," raising questions about the fairness and transparency of the selection process.
*   **Lack of Justification:** Insufficient justification for deeming candidates "not suitable" was a recurring concern, particularly when candidates possessed relevant experience and qualifications.
*   **Adherence to Reservation:** The panel called for strict adherence to reservation policies in all university recruitments, emphasizing that these policies are not merely guidelines but constitutional mandates.
*   **Transparent Assessment:** Recommendations were made for universities to establish clearer and more transparent criteria for assessing suitability, ensuring that subjective evaluations do not inadvertently lead to discrimination.
*   **Review Mechanisms:** The committee suggested implementing robust review mechanisms for cases where experienced SC/ST candidates are rejected, allowing for a re-evaluation of the decision and ensuring accountability.
*   **Increased Representation:** The report reiterated the urgent need for universities to actively work towards increasing the representation of SC/ST faculty members across all departments and levels.

The findings from the parliamentary panel underscore the ongoing challenges faced by SC/ST communities in accessing equitable opportunities in higher education employment. The committee has urged the Ministry of Education and the University Grants Commission (UGC) to take immediate and concrete steps to address these issues. This includes ensuring stricter monitoring of recruitment processes and penalizing institutions found to be non-compliant with reservation norms. The panel's report highlights a critical juncture for policymakers to reinforce the principles of social justice and equality in India's academic landscape.
