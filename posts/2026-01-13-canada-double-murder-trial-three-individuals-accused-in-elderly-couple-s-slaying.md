A double murder trial is underway in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, involving three Indian nationals accused of killing an elderly couple, Prem Singh, 71, and Michele Singh, 70, in December 2020. Gurkaran Singh, Gursimran Singh, and Sukhmanpreet Singh face charges related to the slayings, which prosecutors allege were motivated by financial gain.

The prosecution detailed that the accused allegedly sought to extort $100,000 from the couple's son and stole $4,000 from the victims' home. Court proceedings have highlighted the background of the accused, particularly Gurkaran Singh, who reportedly arrived in Canada on a student visa in early 2019 but never enrolled in college, instead working in construction. Gursimran Singh, also on a student visa since 2019, worked in construction, while Sukhmanpreet Singh, who arrived in 2018 on a student visa, worked as a truck driver. Gurkaran Singh was allegedly dating the victims' granddaughter at the time of the incident.

The discovery of the crime occurred when the victims' son, Rupesh Singh, found his parents deceased in their home on December 15, 2020, after failing to contact them. He had also received a text message demanding a $100,000 ransom. The victims were found tied up and had sustained multiple stab wounds. Investigators quickly apprehended the three suspects shortly after the bodies were discovered.

During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence suggesting the defendants targeted the elderly couple due to their perceived vulnerability and financial resources. The court heard allegations that the money sought was intended to cover debts accumulated through gambling or drug dealing. Forensic evidence, phone records, and CCTV footage are among the materials being presented by the prosecution to establish the connection between the accused and the murders.

Key details presented in court include:
*   **Victims:** Prem Singh (71) and Michele Singh (70).
*   **Accused:** Gurkaran Singh (20), Gursimran Singh (20), Sukhmanpreet Singh (23).
*   **Alleged Motive:** Financial gain, including a $100,000 ransom demand and the theft of $4,000.
*   **Visa Status:** Gurkaran Singh, Gursimran Singh, and Sukhmanpreet Singh were all in Canada on student visas. Gurkaran Singh reportedly did not pursue studies after arrival.
*   **Method:** The victims were found tied up and stabbed.
*   **Discovery:** The couple's son found them deceased after receiving a ransom text message.

The trial continues to unfold in Surrey, British Columbia, with further evidence and testimonies expected to be presented as legal proceedings advance.
