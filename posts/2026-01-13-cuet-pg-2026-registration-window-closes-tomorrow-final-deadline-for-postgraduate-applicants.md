New Delhi, India – The registration window for the Common University Entrance Test (Postgraduate) 2026, abbreviated as CUET PG 2026, is scheduled to close tomorrow, May 15, 2026. Administered by the National Testing Agency (NTA), this examination serves as a crucial gateway for admission to various postgraduate programs offered by central and participating universities across India. Aspiring candidates who intend to pursue master's degrees for the academic session 2026-27 must complete their application process on the official NTA CUET PG portal before the stipulated deadline.

The CUET PG examination aims to streamline the admission process for postgraduate courses, providing a single window opportunity for students seeking entry into a diverse range of disciplines, including humanities, sciences, commerce, law, and engineering, among others. The initiative reduces the burden on students of applying to multiple universities individually and standardizes the evaluation process for university admissions nationwide. The NTA emphasizes the importance of timely submission to avoid technical issues or last-minute rushes, which could prevent eligible candidates from applying.

Prospective applicants are required to register and submit their forms exclusively through the designated online portal. The application process involves several steps, including personal detail submission, academic qualification entry, selection of desired courses and universities, uploading of necessary documents, and payment of the applicable application fee. Incomplete applications or those with outstanding fee payments will not be considered valid by the NTA.

Key details for CUET PG 2026 applicants include:
*   **Final Registration Deadline:** May 15, 2026, by 11:50 PM IST.
*   **Official Application Website:** Candidates must apply via the official NTA CUET PG portal (e.g., pgcuet.samarth.ac.in).
*   **Application Fee:** Fees vary based on the number of subjects chosen and the candidate's category (General, OBC-NCL, SC/ST/PwBD). Payment must be made online through approved methods.
*   **Required Documents:** Digital copies of passport-sized photographs, signatures, and category certificates (if applicable) are typically required as per NTA specifications.
*   **Eligibility Criteria:** Candidates are strongly advised to meticulously review the eligibility requirements for their chosen programs and universities as specified in the official CUET PG 2026 Information Bulletin.

Following the closure of the registration window, the NTA typically provides a short window for application form corrections. This period allows candidates to rectify specific errors in their submitted forms, although changes to certain critical fields, such as the applicant's name, date of birth, or email ID, are often restricted. Accuracy during the initial application phase is therefore paramount.

Once the registration and correction phases are complete, the NTA will proceed with issuing admit cards to eligible candidates, followed by the conduct of the examination on the announced dates. Students are encouraged to regularly visit the official NTA website for the latest updates regarding admit card releases, examination schedules, and subsequent result declarations. Missing the May 15 deadline means forfeiture of the opportunity to appear for CUET PG 2026, thereby impacting admissions for the upcoming academic year.
