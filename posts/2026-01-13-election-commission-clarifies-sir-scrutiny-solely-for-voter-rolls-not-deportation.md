NEW DELHI – The Election Commission of India (ECI) has clarified that its "Systematic Identiﬁcation of Risky Voters" (SIR) program is solely aimed at purifying electoral rolls and is not intended for identifying individuals for deportation. This assertion was made amidst ongoing discussions surrounding electoral reforms and the critical importance of maintaining accurate voter lists across the nation.

Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra, speaking on the matter, emphasized that the EC's primary objective with such initiatives is to ensure the integrity of the electoral process. He stated that the SIR program focuses exclusively on removing duplicate entries, deceased voters, and ineligible names from the electoral database, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of voter rolls. This clarification seeks to address concerns, particularly prevalent in regions where voter identity scrutiny often intersects with sensitive issues of citizenship and residency.

The clarification comes in the context of the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which includes provisions for linking Aadhaar with voter ID on a voluntary basis. While the linking of Aadhaar is intended to further purify voter rolls by facilitating de-duplication, the EC underscored that the SIR program is a distinct process, operating within existing legal frameworks to identify discrepancies. The Commission reiterated that any information gathered or processed through SIR is strictly for the purpose of electoral roll management and holds no bearing on an individual’s citizenship status or any subsequent deportation proceedings.

Concerns regarding the potential misuse of voter scrutiny programs have historically been voiced, particularly in states like Assam, where the process of identifying "doubtful" voters has led to significant social and legal complexities related to the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The EC's explicit statement aims to draw a clear distinction between its statutory mandate of maintaining accurate voter lists and the separate governmental functions pertaining to citizenship verification and deportation.

Key aspects of the EC's clarification include:
*   **Sole Purpose:** The SIR program's only objective is the purification of voter rolls.
*   **No Link to Deportation:** Data from SIR is explicitly not used for identifying individuals for deportation.
*   **CEC Statement:** Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra affirmed the program's focus on electoral integrity.
*   **Context of Reforms:** Clarification follows the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which introduced voluntary Aadhaar-voter ID linking.
*   **Aadhaar Distinction:** SIR is separate from the Aadhaar-voter ID linking initiative.
*   **Regional Relevance:** Addresses specific sensitivities in states like Assam, related to citizenship and voter status.

The Election Commission maintains that its efforts are geared towards strengthening India's democratic framework by ensuring that only eligible citizens are registered to vote and that electoral rolls are free from errors. This latest clarification reinforces the EC's commitment to transparency and adherence to its constitutional mandate of conducting free and fair elections, ensuring public confidence in the electoral system as it continues its ongoing process of voter roll maintenance and refinement.
