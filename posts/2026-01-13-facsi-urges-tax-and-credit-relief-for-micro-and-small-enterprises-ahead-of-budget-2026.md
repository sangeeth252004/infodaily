The Federation of All India Small and Medium Enterprises (FACSI) has formally urged the government to introduce comprehensive tax and credit relief measures for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in the upcoming Union Budget 2026. The recommendation, delivered through an official announcement, underscores the critical role MSEs play in the national economy and highlights the significant challenges they currently face.

FACSI's call for intervention is rooted in the belief that a robust MSE sector is fundamental to sustained economic recovery and job creation. Micro and Small Enterprises collectively contribute substantially to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exports, and are a primary source of employment across various sectors. However, these businesses often operate with limited capital, face intense competition, and are particularly vulnerable to economic fluctuations, rising input costs, and global supply chain disruptions.

The industry body emphasized that targeted relief would not only support the survival and growth of existing MSEs but also encourage new entrepreneurship. Access to affordable credit and a favorable tax environment are identified as key enablers for these businesses to innovate, expand, and contribute more effectively to the national economy. Without adequate support, many MSEs struggle with liquidity, hindering their ability to invest in technology, upgrade infrastructure, or scale operations.

Key aspects of FACSI's recommendations include:

*   **Streamlined Taxation:** Calls for simplification of tax compliance procedures and consideration of reduced corporate tax rates for MSEs, especially those below a certain turnover threshold. This aims to lessen the financial burden and administrative complexity faced by small businesses.
*   **Enhanced Credit Access:** Advocates for easier and more affordable access to institutional credit. This includes proposals for lower interest rates on working capital and term loans, an expansion of government-backed credit guarantee schemes, and measures to ensure timely disbursement of funds.
*   **Liquidity Support:** Suggests mechanisms to improve cash flow, such as faster processing of Goods and Services Tax (GST) refunds and provisions to ensure timely payments from larger entities to MSEs for goods and services rendered.
*   **Incentives for Digitalization and Skilling:** Recommends tax incentives or subsidies for MSEs investing in digital transformation, technology adoption, and employee skill development programs to enhance competitiveness.

The federation's recommendations are part of the ongoing pre-budget consultation process, where various industry associations and stakeholders present their proposals to the Ministry of Finance. These consultations are crucial in shaping the government's economic policies and fiscal strategies for the forthcoming financial year. The government's consideration of these proposals will be pivotal for the MSE sector's trajectory in the coming years. A decision on these and other recommendations is expected to be announced during the presentation of the Union Budget 2026.
