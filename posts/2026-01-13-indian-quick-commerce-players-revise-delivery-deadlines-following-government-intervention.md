In a significant development for India's rapidly expanding quick commerce sector, Blinkit, the instant delivery platform owned by Zomato, has removed its prominent "10-minute delivery" promise from its service. This move, which became effective around March 2022, followed an urgent appeal from the Indian Centre to quick commerce companies to abandon aggressive delivery time limits, citing concerns over the safety and working conditions of gig workers. The government's intervention underscores increasing scrutiny on the operational practices of technology-driven delivery platforms across the country.

The decision by Blinkit, a key player in the quick commerce market, marks a notable shift from a strategy that prioritized rapid delivery times as a primary competitive advantage. The aggressive 10-minute delivery window had drawn widespread criticism from various stakeholders, including safety advocates, worker rights organizations, and the general public. Concerns were primarily centered on the immense pressure placed on delivery executives, often leading to unsafe driving practices, violations of traffic rules, and increased risk of accidents in an effort to meet stringent deadlines.

Officials from the Indian government, particularly from the Ministry of Labour and Employment, had expressed strong reservations regarding the potential for such tight delivery schedules to compromise the welfare and safety of gig workers. The Centre highlighted that while innovation and speed were important for consumer convenience, they should not come at the expense of human safety and dignified working conditions. This official stance prompted a re-evaluation of business models that heavily relied on speed as their core differentiator.

Following the government's urging, Blinkit began phasing out the "10 minutes" guarantee from its app interface and promotional materials. Instead, the platform transitioned to displaying estimated delivery times, a practice more common in traditional food and grocery delivery services. This adjustment is expected to alleviate some of the pressure on its fleet of delivery partners, allowing for more reasonable travel speeds and adherence to traffic regulations. While Blinkit was the first to publicly alter its policy, other quick commerce players operating in India, such as Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and Dunzo, also faced similar calls for reassessment of their delivery timeframes.

The broader implications of this development extend beyond individual company policies, signaling a potential recalibration of the quick commerce industry in India. It highlights a growing emphasis on balancing operational efficiency and profitability with corporate responsibility towards its workforce. This regulatory push by the Indian government is part of a larger, ongoing effort to establish more comprehensive frameworks for gig economy workers, addressing issues such as social security benefits, fair wages, and safer working environments. The adjustments by quick commerce firms are anticipated to set a precedent, influencing how speed-centric services are designed and marketed in the future, with a greater focus on sustainable practices that prioritize human welfare alongside consumer convenience.
