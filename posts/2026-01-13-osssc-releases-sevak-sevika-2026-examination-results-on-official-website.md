The Odisha Sub-ordinate Staff Selection Commission (OSSSC) has officially announced the release of the Sevak Sevika examination results for the year 2026. Candidates who appeared for the recruitment drive can now access their scorecards and check their qualification status directly on the commission’s designated website, osssc.gov.in. This announcement marks a significant step for thousands of aspirants seeking employment within various district establishments and Gram Panchayats across Odisha.

The Sevak Sevika recruitment drive aims to fill a substantial number of posts essential for local administration and community support functions across the state. The examination process typically involves a written test, followed by subsequent stages such as document verification for qualified candidates. The release of these results allows successful candidates to proceed to the next phase of the selection process, moving closer to securing positions that play a crucial role in grassroots governance and public service delivery. The commission had previously conducted the written examination earlier this year as part of its scheduled recruitment calendar for 2026.

This recruitment initiative is part of the Odisha government's ongoing efforts to strengthen local administrative bodies and ensure efficient service delivery to citizens. Sevaks and Sevikas are integral to various schemes and initiatives at the village level, working closely with communities on development projects, welfare programs, and administrative tasks. The demand for these roles underscores their importance in connecting government services with the populace, particularly in rural areas. The transparency of the online result system ensures that all candidates have equitable access to their performance data immediately upon release.

Key details regarding the result download and subsequent steps are as follows:

*   **Accessing Results:** Candidates must visit the official OSSSC website, osssc.gov.in.
*   **Direct Link:** A prominent link for "Result of Sevak Sevika Recruitment 2026" is available on the homepage.

*   **Print Option:** It is advisable for candidates to download and print a copy of their scorecard for future reference and for the upcoming document verification process.

Following the publication of these results, the OSSSC is expected to issue further notifications regarding the schedule for document verification. Qualified candidates will be required to present original copies of their academic certificates, identity proof, caste certificates (if applicable), and other relevant documents for scrutiny. The final selection list will be prepared based on the performance in the written examination and the successful completion of the document verification process. Aspirants are advised to regularly check the OSSSC website for updates on these crucial subsequent stages to ensure they do not miss any deadlines.
