Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir reported multiple sightings of suspected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) originating from Pakistan along the Line of Control (LoC) within a 48-hour period in late April 2022. These incidents, occurring across various sectors, have prompted an escalation in vigilance and intensified search operations by Indian troops in the region.

The recurring drone activity signifies a persistent security challenge for border management agencies. Official reports indicated that the first sighting occurred on April 26, 2022, when a drone was observed flying over Indian airspace in a border sector of Jammu and Kashmir. Less than 48 hours later, on April 28, 2022, another drone was detected in a separate area along the LoC. These repeated incursions necessitate continuous monitoring and robust response mechanisms from Indian security forces, including the Indian Army and the Border Security Force (BSF).

Details regarding the recent incidents include:
*   **Multiple Sightings:** Drones were reportedly observed in different sectors along the LoC, indicating widespread activity.
*   **Response Measures:** Following each sighting, security personnel initiated search operations in the surrounding areas to investigate potential payload drops, such as weapons, narcotics, or reconnaissance equipment.
*   **Heightened Alert:** Security establishments have been placed on high alert across the Jammu and Kashmir border region, with increased surveillance and patrol activities.

Authorities have indicated that these drone activities are consistent with previous attempts by hostile elements to conduct reconnaissance, smuggle contraband, or drop weapons into Indian territory. Past incidents in the region have seen drones used for transporting narcotics, arms, and ammunition, often intended for militant groups operating within Jammu and Kashmir. The consistent use of UAVs underscores an evolving cross-border threat landscape, requiring adapted counter-measures.

The Indian Army and the BSF maintain a strict posture along the LoC. Troops are equipped to detect and, if necessary, engage such aerial threats. The primary objective of the increased surveillance is to intercept any drone attempting to breach Indian airspace with malicious intent and to neutralize any material it might be carrying.

Moving forward, security agencies are expected to continue enhancing technological capabilities for drone detection and interception. This includes deploying advanced radar systems, anti-drone jammers, and other counter-UAV technologies. The persistent threat posed by these aerial incursions ensures that border security remains a critical focus, with forces maintaining a state of readiness to counter any future attempts at infiltration or reconnaissance.
