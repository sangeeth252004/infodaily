Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir launched extensive search operations in parts of Kathua district on Friday, March 18, 2022, following reports of gunshots and suspicious activity. The operations were initiated in response to alerts from local residents regarding the sound of firing, primarily concentrating on the border areas of the region.

The coordinated effort involved personnel from the Jammu and Kashmir Police, along with elements of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Indian Army. Multiple teams were deployed to cordon off potential areas of interest, including dense forest tracts and residential zones near the International Border (IB) with Pakistan. The primary objective of these operations was to sanitize the area, investigate the source of the reported gunshots, and track down any individuals involved in suspicious movement.

Key details of the ongoing operations include:

*   **Location:** The search operations were concentrated in the border belt of Kathua district, particularly in areas susceptible to infiltration.
*   **Trigger:** Reports from residents of hearing gunshots prompted the rapid deployment of security personnel. These reports also mentioned suspicious movement, indicating a potential security threat.
*   **Forces Involved:** A multi-agency response, including the Jammu and Kashmir Police, CRPF, and the Indian Army, was activated to ensure comprehensive coverage and coordination.
*   **Methodology:** Cordon and search operations (CASO) were implemented in identified sensitive locations. This involved systematically checking specific areas, buildings, and natural cover for any hidden threats or individuals.
*   **Vigilance:** Enhanced vigilance has been established across the district, with particular focus on checking vehicles and monitoring routes that could be used for transit.

The operations underscore the persistent security challenges faced in the Union Territory, particularly in its border districts. Such incidents often trigger a heightened state of alert to prevent any potential militant infiltration or activity. Authorities have urged residents to remain vigilant and report any unusual observations to security forces.

As of the latest reports, search operations were continuing in the region. Security forces remain on high alert, meticulously combing the area to ensure peace and stability. Further details regarding the outcome of the operations are expected as the situation develops.
