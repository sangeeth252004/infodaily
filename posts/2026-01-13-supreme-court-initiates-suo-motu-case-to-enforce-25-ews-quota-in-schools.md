New Delhi – The Supreme Court of India has recently initiated a suo motu (on its own motion) case aimed at ensuring the diligent implementation of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, specifically its provision mandating 25% reservation for children from economically weaker sections (EWS) and disadvantaged groups in private unaided schools. A bench comprising Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, Justice Hima Kohli, and Justice C.T. Ravikumar, taking cognizance of widespread non-compliance, has issued notices to the Union Ministry of Education, all state governments, and Union Territories, seeking their responses on the matter.

This proactive step by the apex court underscores the persistent challenges in integrating underprivileged children into mainstream education, despite the RTE Act being in effect for over a decade. The Act, a landmark legislation, aims to provide free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of six and fourteen years. Section 12(1)(c) of the Act specifically stipulates that private unaided schools must admit at least 25% of their entry-level class strength from EWS and disadvantaged groups, with the government reimbursing the schools for these admissions.

The court's decision to intervene highlights reports and public interest litigations indicating a significant gap between the statutory mandate and its ground-level execution. Many eligible children from EWS backgrounds reportedly continue to face barriers in accessing these reserved seats, often due to a lack of awareness, logistical hurdles, or alleged non-cooperation from certain educational institutions. Furthermore, issues surrounding timely and adequate reimbursement from state governments to schools for EWS admissions have frequently been cited as a reason for schools' reluctance to comply fully.

Key aspects of the Supreme Court's action and the RTE provision include:
*   **Legal Mandate:** The 25% reservation is a statutory right under Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act, 2009.
*   **Target Beneficiaries:** Children from economically weaker sections and disadvantaged groups, ensuring inclusive education.
*   **Scope:** Applies to private unaided schools, excluding minority institutions under certain conditions.
*   **Reimbursement Mechanism:** State governments are obligated to reimburse schools for the expenditure incurred on these students, up to a specified per-child cost.
*   **Judicial Oversight:** The suo motu case signifies the Supreme Court's commitment to enforce fundamental rights and constitutional provisions related to education.

The initiation of this case by the Supreme Court serves as a significant push towards greater accountability and equity in India's education system. It places direct responsibility on central and state administrations to review and strengthen their mechanisms for enforcing the RTE Act's provisions. The court's directive implies an expectation for detailed responses from governments outlining the current status of implementation, challenges faced, and proposed solutions to ensure that the constitutional right to education reaches all sections of society, particularly the most vulnerable. The next phase will likely involve the court reviewing the submitted responses and potentially issuing further directions or guidelines to streamline the admission process and ensure sustained compliance nationwide.
