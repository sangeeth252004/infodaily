The Indian cryptocurrency industry is closely monitoring the discourse surrounding the upcoming Union Budget 2026, with significant anticipation for potential adjustments to the existing tax framework for Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs). Stakeholders are actively advocating for a more favorable tax regime, citing concerns over the impact of current provisions on market growth, investor participation, and domestic innovation.

The existing tax structure for VDAs was introduced during Union Budget 2022. Key provisions of this framework include:

*   A flat 30% tax levied on income generated from the transfer of any VDA.
*   A 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on VDA transactions exceeding a specified threshold.
*   A prohibition on offsetting losses incurred from VDA transfers against any other income.
*   The inability to carry forward VDA losses to subsequent financial years.

Since the implementation of these measures, industry representatives and market participants have expressed concerns regarding their impact. Reports from various exchanges and analytics firms have indicated a notable decrease in trading volumes and a potential migration of domestic investors and talent to jurisdictions with more accommodative policies. The primary argument from the industry is that the current regime, particularly the high tax rate and the inability to offset losses, categorizes VDAs akin to speculative activities like gambling, rather than recognizing them as emerging assets or technologies.

Industry bodies and individual companies have consistently appealed to the Ministry of Finance and other relevant authorities for a comprehensive review of these provisions. Their key demands and suggestions for Budget 2026 include:

*   **Reduction in Tax Rate:** A call for the 30% tax rate on VDA income to be lowered, potentially aligning it with capital gains tax rates applicable to other asset classes, which range from 15% to 20%.
*   **Loss Offset and Carry Forward:** The allowance for investors to offset losses from VDA trades against other VDA gains or income, and the ability to carry forward such losses to future financial years. This is seen as crucial for encouraging responsible trading and mitigating risks for investors.
*   **Revisiting TDS Provisions:** A re-evaluation of the 1% TDS, with suggestions to either reduce it or apply it more judiciously to avoid liquidity issues, particularly for high-frequency traders.
*   **Clearer Regulatory Framework:** Beyond tax, the industry continues to seek a clearer and more comprehensive regulatory framework that defines VDAs and provides legal certainty, which could foster greater institutional participation and innovation within India.

The government's previous stance has largely focused on safeguarding investors and maintaining financial stability, viewing VDAs with caution due to their volatile nature and potential for misuse. However, global discussions on cryptocurrency regulation, including those within G20 forums, are evolving, potentially influencing India's approach. While no official indications of policy changes for Budget 2026 have been made public, the continuous advocacy highlights the industry's sustained efforts to shape a more conducive environment for virtual digital assets in India. The coming months are expected to see intensified dialogue as stakeholders prepare for the next Union Budget cycle, which could significantly impact the trajectory of India's digital asset economy.
