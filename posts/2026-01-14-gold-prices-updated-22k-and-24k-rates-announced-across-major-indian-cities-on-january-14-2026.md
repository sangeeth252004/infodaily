Commodity markets across India released their updated gold prices for 22-carat and 24-carat purity on January 14, 2026. The daily revision reflected indicative rates for key metropolitan areas including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, and Patna, providing essential information for investors, consumers, and the jewellery industry. These rates, typically quoted per 10 grams and 1 gram, are a significant economic indicator in India, where gold holds substantial cultural and financial importance.

The publication of daily gold rates is a standard practice in India, crucial for transparency in the precious metals market. Prices for 22-carat gold, primarily used for crafting jewellery, and 24-carat gold, the purest form often preferred for investment, showed variations influenced by a confluence of international and domestic factors. These include global gold demand and supply dynamics, fluctuations in the rupee-dollar exchange rate, import duties, and monetary policies set by central banks. The market data on January 14, 2026, underscored the dynamic nature of gold pricing within the country.

For consumers and investors, understanding the distinction between 22-carat and 24-carat gold is vital. While 24-carat gold represents 99.9% purity, 22-carat gold contains 91.6% gold, with the remainder composed of other metals like copper or silver to enhance durability, making it suitable for intricate designs. The price difference between these purities is consistently observed in daily market reports.

Key indicative rates for January 14, 2026, as reported by financial news outlets and commodity exchanges, included:

Consumers are typically advised to verify real-time rates with their chosen vendor before any transaction.

The gold market remains under constant observation by analysts, with prices expected to continue their daily fluctuations driven by global economic developments, geopolitical events, and domestic market sentiment.
