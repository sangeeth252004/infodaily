Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir – Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha of Jammu & Kashmir has dismissed five government employees from service due to their alleged links with terror outfits. The dismissals, announced recently, underscore the Union Territory administration's firm stance against individuals suspected of compromising national security from within governmental ranks.

The decision to terminate the services of these individuals was made under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India. This specific provision allows for the dismissal of a government employee without an inquiry if the President or Governor is satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable to hold such an inquiry, particularly in cases involving national security. The J&K administration has utilized this constitutional provision in previous instances to address similar concerns, aiming to safeguard the integrity of public service.

The five employees were reportedly working in various government departments across Jammu & Kashmir. While specific details about their individual roles or the precise nature of their alleged connections to terror groups were not immediately released, official sources indicated that investigations provided sufficient grounds for their termination under the stringent security clause. This action is part of a broader strategy by the J&K administration to identify and neutralize elements suspected of aiding or abetting terrorism and secessionist activities.

Officials emphasized that such measures are imperative for maintaining the integrity of government services and ensuring the safety and security of the region. The administration has reiterated its zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and its ecosystem, asserting that public servants must uphold the highest standards of loyalty to the nation and the Constitution.

**Key Details:**
*   **Number of dismissals:** Five government employees.
*   **Legal basis:** Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India.
*   **Reason:** Alleged links with terror outfits.
*   **Procedure:** No formal inquiry is required under this specific constitutional provision due to national security implications.
*   **Context:** These dismissals are part of an ongoing effort by the J&K administration. According to official data, a total of 44 government employees have been dismissed in Jammu & Kashmir under Article 311(2)(c) since April 2021, on similar grounds of anti-national activities or terror links.
*   **Authority:** The dismissals were ordered by the Lieutenant Governor, who acts as the constitutional head of the Union Territory.

The J&K administration has stated its commitment to thoroughly vetting employees and ensuring that no individual with alleged terror affiliations remains within the government system. These recent dismissals signal continued vigilance and a resolute approach to counter-terrorism efforts, aiming to foster an environment of peace and stability in the Union Territory. Further actions are expected to reinforce governance and security across the region.
