Rajkot, India – January 28, 2023 – Indian cricketer KL Rahul etched his name into the record books today, becoming the first Indian wicket-keeper to score a century while batting at the crucial number four position in a One Day International (ODI) match. The significant achievement came during the second ODI of the ongoing series against New Zealand at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot, where India secured a vital victory.

Rahul’s commanding knock of 108 runs from 95 deliveries, featuring eight boundaries and five sixes, anchored the Indian innings after early wickets. His innings not only propelled India to a competitive total of 306 for 7 but also highlighted his growing influence as a multi-faceted player in the national squad. This specific batting position, combined with his keeping duties, marks a unique milestone previously untouched by celebrated Indian wicket-keepers such as MS Dhoni or Rishabh Pant.

The rarity of this feat underscores Rahul’s versatility and adaptability, qualities increasingly valued in modern limited-overs cricket. While MS Dhoni primarily batted lower down the order as a finisher for most of his illustrious career as a wicket-keeper, and Rishabh Pant has had fewer opportunities to consistently bat at number four while keeping in ODIs, Rahul has embraced this demanding dual role with distinction. His performance in Rajkot provided stability and acceleration, proving critical in setting a challenging target for the New Zealand side.

Key details from the match and Rahul’s performance include:

*   **Match:** 2nd One Day International, India vs. New Zealand
*   **Date:** January 28, 2023
*   **Venue:** Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Rajkot
*   **Rahul's Score:** 108 runs off 95 balls
*   **Batting Position:** Number four
*   **Role:** Wicket-keeper and batsman
*   **Match Result:** India defeated New Zealand by 27 runs.

This achievement follows a period where Rahul has consistently delivered strong performances for India across formats, particularly when entrusted with wicket-keeping responsibilities. His ability to perform a high-pressure batting role in the middle order while also managing the demands of keeping wickets for 50 overs adds significant balance and depth to the Indian team composition. Such flexibility offers captain Rohit Sharma and head coach Rahul Dravid more strategic options, especially in the lead-up to major tournaments.

Team management has frequently praised Rahul's commitment to adapting to various roles for the team's benefit. This century further solidifies his position as a vital cog, capable of stepping up under pressure and delivering match-winning performances. The focus for Rahul and the Indian team will now shift to maintaining this momentum as they continue the series against New Zealand, with an eye on upcoming international assignments and the preparations for the next major global cricket event.
