The Madhya Pradesh government has officially confirmed 15 deaths in Indore attributed to contaminated water, two weeks after an outbreak of waterborne illnesses began affecting residents. The Public Health and Family Welfare Minister, Dr. Prabhuram Chaudhary, acknowledged the fatalities and the widespread health crisis on Monday, March 28, 2022.

The admission follows a period where local authorities had initially attributed several deaths to other causes. Over 2,000 cases of diarrhea and vomiting have been reported across Indore, primarily impacting areas such as Chandan Nagar and other western parts of the city. The health minister visited Indore to assess the gravity of the situation and outlined the government's response.

Dr. Chaudhary stated that the 15 deaths were due to "different reasons, including water contamination," indicating a multi-faceted health challenge exacerbated by unsafe drinking water. The outbreak's severity prompted immediate governmental action aimed at containing the spread and addressing public health concerns.

Key details and government measures include:
*   **Confirmed Fatalities:** 15 deaths officially linked to the contaminated water outbreak.
*   **Extensive Cases:** More than 2,000 individuals have reported symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting, consistent with gastroenteritis.
*   **Affected Areas:** Chandan Nagar and other western localities of Indore are among the most severely impacted.
*   **Health Camps:** The administration has established 25 health camps throughout the affected regions to provide immediate medical assistance and screenings to residents.
*   **Water Sample Collection:** Approximately 1,500 water samples have been collected from various sources for testing. This initiative aims to identify the exact contaminants and their origins within the city's water supply network.
*   **Ongoing Investigations:** Both the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) and the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) are conducting investigations into the water supply infrastructure. These probes focus on identifying potential contamination points, including issues with Narmada water lines and older pipeline networks.
*   **Ministerial Oversight:** PHED Minister Brijendra Singh Yadav confirmed receiving reports from the collector and commissioner regarding the deaths and the ongoing crisis.

The government has emphasized its commitment to ensuring safe drinking water for all residents and preventing future occurrences of such a health crisis. Authorities are reportedly working to implement long-term solutions to upgrade and secure the city's water infrastructure. Further reports on the investigations and additional public health measures are anticipated as the situation continues to unfold.
