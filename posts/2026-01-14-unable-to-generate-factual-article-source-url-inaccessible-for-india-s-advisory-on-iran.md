This request for a factual news article regarding India's advisory to its citizens in Iran cannot be fully fulfilled as specified. The provided source URL, `https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/leave-iran-indias-stark-advisory-amid-threat-of-us-attack-protests-spread/articleshow/126524206.cms`, was inaccessible or returned a "page not found" error during the information gathering process.

To produce a factual, objective, and detailed news report that adheres to journalistic standards, access to the specific information and verifiable details from the designated source material is essential. Without the content of the referenced article, it is impossible to accurately report on the 'who, what, when, where' of the advisory, the specific context of the 'threat of US attack,' or the verified details concerning the 'protests spread' in Iran, as indicated by the proposed article title.

Generating information or fabricating details without a verifiable source would contravene the core requirements of factual reporting, objectivity, and the explicit instruction to avoid false claims or unsupported statements. Professional journalism mandates the direct referencing and verification of facts, especially concerning sensitive geopolitical topics.

Therefore, this response serves to clearly communicate the inability to proceed with the content generation for the requested article while maintaining journalistic integrity and accuracy. Should an accessible source or alternative factual details be provided, a comprehensive article can then be drafted in accordance with all specified stylistic and structural requirements.
