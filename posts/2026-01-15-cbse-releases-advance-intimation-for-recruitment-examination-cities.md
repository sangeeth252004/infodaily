The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has announced the release of advance intimation slips detailing the examination city for candidates appearing in its upcoming recruitment examinations. This crucial notification allows registered applicants to ascertain their assigned test city well in advance of the examination dates, facilitating necessary travel and logistical arrangements. Candidates are advised to access the official CBSE website to view their city intimation.

This advance notification is a standard practice aimed at assisting candidates in planning their commute and accommodation, thereby reducing last-minute stress. The intimation slip provides information solely on the examination city and should not be mistaken for the admit card, which will be issued separately and will contain precise details such as the examination centre address, date, time, and candidate-specific instructions. The release pertains to various posts for which the recruitment drive is underway.

Key details regarding the city intimation and subsequent examination process:
*   **Access Point:** Candidates must visit the official CBSE website, cbse.nic.in, to download their advance intimation slip.
*   **Required Credentials:** Access to the intimation slip requires the candidate's application number and date of birth.
*   **Purpose:** The slip exclusively informs candidates about the city where their examination will be conducted. It does not include the specific examination venue, which will be provided on the admit card.
*   **Posts Covered:** The current intimation is applicable for a range of positions, potentially including Assistant Secretary, Assistant Secretary (IT), Accounts Officer, Junior Engineer, Junior Translator, and various other administrative and technical roles. Specific details regarding the covered posts are available in the initial recruitment notification.
*   **Examination Dates:** While the city intimation is out, the exact examination dates for all posts are detailed in the official schedule released by CBSE. Candidates are urged to refer to the official notification for their specific exam dates.
*   **Admit Card Release:** The final admit cards, which are mandatory for entry into the examination hall, are expected to be released a few days prior to the commencement of the examinations. These will contain comprehensive details including the full address of the examination centre, reporting time, and specific instructions for candidates.

Candidates are strongly advised to download and review their city intimation slip immediately to confirm their assigned examination city. It is recommended to verify all details on the slip and keep it for reference. In case of any discrepancies or difficulty in downloading the intimation slip, candidates should contact the CBSE recruitment helpline or the designated support email address provided in the original recruitment notification.

CBSE continues to underscore the importance of regularly checking its official website for the latest updates, including the release of admit cards and any further announcements pertinent to the recruitment process. Aspirants should remain vigilant for official communications and avoid relying on unverified sources for critical examination information.
