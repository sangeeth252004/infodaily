Mumbai, India – In October 2022, immigration attorney Poorvi Chothani clarified India's current standing regarding specific U.S. visa categories, particularly the E-1 Treaty Trader and E-2 Treaty Investor non-immigrant visas, and addressed hypothetical discussions around a potential "visa freeze" for Indian nationals. Her statements, reported by Times of India, highlighted key distinctions in U.S. immigration policy impacting Indian citizens.

Chothani explained that India does not currently qualify for E-1 and E-2 visas due to the absence of a required bilateral treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States. These visa categories are reserved for citizens of countries that maintain such treaties, allowing them to engage in substantial trade or make significant investments in the U.S. While the original reporting title alluded to India being "low on using" these visas, the attorney's clarification indicated that it is an issue of eligibility rather than underutilization by Indian applicants.

The attorney further elaborated on the conditions necessary for E-1 and E-2 visa eligibility:
*   **E-1 (Treaty Trader) Visa:** Permits nationals of treaty countries to enter the U.S. to carry on substantial trade, including trade in services or technology, principally between the U.S. and their treaty country.
*   **E-2 (Treaty Investor) Visa:** Allows nationals of treaty countries to enter the U.S. to develop and direct the operations of an enterprise in which they have invested a substantial amount of capital.

Without the foundational treaty, Indian citizens cannot apply for these specific visa types, regardless of their trade or investment intentions. This distinction is crucial for understanding India's engagement with the broader U.S. visa system.

Addressing the hypothetical scenario of a "visa freeze," Chothani stated that a broad, blanket freeze across all U.S. visa categories for Indian nationals is unlikely based on current immigration frameworks and diplomatic relations. Discussions surrounding a "visa freeze" often arise in specific contexts, such as heightened national security concerns, significant policy shifts, or issues pertaining to specific visa programs, rather than a general cessation of visa services for an entire country.

India remains a significant source of applicants for other U.S. visa categories, including H-1B visas for skilled workers, L-1 visas for intra-company transfers, F-1 visas for students, and B-1/B-2 visas for business and tourism. The U.S. processes a substantial volume of these applications annually from India, reflecting strong economic and educational ties between the two nations. The attorney's comments specifically focused on treaty-based visas, which operate under different bilateral agreements.

As of the reported statements, there has been no indication of new bilateral treaty negotiations between India and the U.S. that would enable Indian citizens to qualify for E-1 and E-2 visas. Consequently, the eligibility status for these specific non-immigrant categories remains unchanged, while other visa pathways continue to operate under existing regulations.
