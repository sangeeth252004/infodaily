The Indian government has initiated preparations to evacuate its nationals residing in Iran, with the first repatriation flight from Tehran to New Delhi anticipated to depart as early as Friday. This move comes in response to reports of ongoing unrest within Iran, prompting the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to prioritize the safety and structured return of Indian citizens.

Official sources within the MEA confirmed that a comprehensive plan is being activated to facilitate the return of thousands of Indians, including students, professionals, and workers, across various Iranian cities. The MEA has been actively monitoring the situation in Iran and has engaged with its embassy in Tehran to assess the welfare of the Indian diaspora. The decision to commence evacuation flights underscores the government's commitment to ensuring the security of its citizens abroad during periods of instability.

The initial phase of the evacuation operation is expected to utilize commercial airlines, with specific details regarding flight schedules and passenger capacity being finalized. The first flight is provisionally scheduled to carry Indian nationals from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport directly to Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. Passengers will undergo necessary health screenings upon arrival, in adherence to established public health protocols.

*   **Coordination:** The Indian Embassy in Tehran is actively coordinating with Iranian authorities to secure necessary clearances for the evacuation flights and facilitate the safe passage of Indian nationals to the departure points.
*   **Registration:** Indian citizens in Iran wishing to return to India have been advised to register with the Embassy, providing their details to assist with logistics and flight allocations.
*   **Helpline Services:** Dedicated helplines and communication channels have been established by the MEA and the Embassy to provide assistance and information to Indian nationals and their families.

While the specifics of the unrest in Iran were not detailed in the official statements regarding the evacuation, the government's pre-emptive measure aims to mitigate potential risks to its citizens. India has maintained diplomatic relations with Iran for decades, and a significant number of Indian expatriates reside in the country, engaged in various sectors. The focus of this operation remains solely on the safe and orderly repatriation of these individuals.

Looking ahead, the MEA is prepared to conduct additional flights as required, based on the number of registered Indian nationals and the evolving situation on the ground. The Indian Embassy will continue to issue advisories and maintain close contact with the Indian community in Iran, providing updates on further evacuation arrangements and safety guidelines. The government has affirmed its readiness to extend all necessary support to its citizens throughout this process.
