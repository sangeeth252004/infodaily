Bengaluru, India – Infosys Ltd., a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting, announced a 3.2% increase in its consolidated revenue for the third fiscal quarter, ending December 31, 2023. The company simultaneously elevated its revenue guidance for fiscal year 2026, citing a robust pipeline of new business and substantial large deal acquisitions across its key operating segments.

The reported revenue growth surpassed analyst expectations, signaling resilience within the IT services sector amidst evolving global economic conditions. This performance underscores Infosys' strategic focus on digital transformation, cloud migration, and artificial intelligence solutions, which continue to drive client investment. The company's management attributed the positive outlook and strengthened guidance primarily to the consistent momentum in securing significant long-term contracts.

During the quarter, Infosys secured large deals totaling $3.2 billion in Total Contract Value (TCV). These agreements span various industries, including financial services, manufacturing, and retail, and often involve multi-year commitments for digital modernization, enterprise application services, and cybersecurity solutions. Such deal wins are crucial indicators of client confidence and future revenue streams. The company's ability to convert pipeline into executed contracts has been a key factor in its recent performance.

Key financial highlights from Infosys’ third fiscal quarter report include:

*   **Q3 Consolidated Revenue:** $4.77 billion, an increase of 3.2% year-over-year in constant currency terms.
*   **Net Profit:** $840 million, reflecting operational efficiencies and strategic cost management.
*   **Large Deal TCV:** $3.2 billion, demonstrating sustained client demand for integrated digital services.
*   **Revised FY26 Revenue Guidance:** Increased to a range of 5.5% to 7.5% year-over-year growth in constant currency, up from the previous range of 4.5% to 6.5%.

Salil Parekh, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Infosys, noted in the company's earnings call that the strong deal momentum reflects the ongoing criticality of digital transformation initiatives for clients worldwide. He emphasized the company’s differentiated capabilities and execution prowess in delivering value across complex client engagements. Nilanjan Roy, Chief Financial Officer, highlighted prudent financial management and disciplined capital allocation as factors contributing to the robust financial performance.

Looking ahead, Infosys anticipates continued demand for its core services, particularly in areas like generative AI, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise resource planning modernization. The raised FY26 guidance suggests confidence in sustained revenue acceleration through enhanced service offerings and expanding market reach. The company plans to continue investing in talent development, technology platforms, and strategic acquisitions to further capitalize on growth opportunities in the global IT services landscape. Investors and market observers will monitor the company's ability to maintain its deal velocity and convert its increased pipeline into realized revenue in the coming fiscal periods.
