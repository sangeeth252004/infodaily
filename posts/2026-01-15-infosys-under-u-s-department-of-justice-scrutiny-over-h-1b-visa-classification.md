Infosys, a global information technology services and consulting company, has disclosed that it is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) concerning its classification of H-1B visa employees. The company made this revelation in its latest regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bringing increased attention to visa compliance within the technology sector.

The investigation, initiated by the DoJ Civil Division, specifically focuses on how Infosys categorizes its H-1B visa holders. The H-1B visa program is a non-immigrant visa designed to allow U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. This program is a critical component for many technology companies, enabling them to address skill gaps and deploy specialized talent for projects within the United States. Scrutiny from a federal agency such as the DoJ can carry significant legal, operational, and reputational implications for companies operating on a global scale.

This current probe is distinct from previous broader investigations that focused on I-9 employment verification procedures, as highlighted by Infosys in its filing. The emphasis on H-1B classification suggests a granular examination of how the company labels and utilizes its foreign workers under this specific program. Infosys has publicly stated its intention to cooperate fully with the DoJ in this ongoing investigation.

The company has a history of engaging with regulatory oversight concerning visa practices. Key instances of prior regulatory engagement include:

*   **2013 Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA):** Infosys entered into a DPA with the DoJ. This agreement addressed compliance issues related to I-9 employment verification procedures, forms used to verify the identity and employment authorization of individuals hired for employment in the United States.
*   **2017 Visa Fraud Allegation:** An Infosys employee was charged with visa fraud. The allegation involved the use of illegal methods to bring foreign workers into the U.S., underscoring the complexities and legal challenges associated with international visa programs.

These historical events contribute to the broader context of regulatory scrutiny faced by IT service providers that extensively utilize foreign talent for U.S.-based operations. The current DoJ investigation further emphasizes the evolving landscape of immigration compliance and the stringent requirements placed on companies regarding visa program adherence.

The outcome of the DoJ's investigation remains pending. Infosys is expected to continue engaging with federal authorities, providing requested documentation and information throughout the process. Depending on the findings of the investigation, potential outcomes could include the imposition of fines, revisions to company compliance procedures, or other regulatory actions. The technology industry, particularly companies that rely on the H-1B program, will likely monitor these developments closely, as they could signal broader trends in U.S. immigration policy enforcement.
