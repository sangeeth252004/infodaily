The Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) has officially announced the schedule for the third round of NEET PG 2025 counselling. This crucial information is now accessible to all aspiring postgraduate medical candidates on the MCC’s official website, mcc.nic.in. The release of this schedule provides a definitive timeline for the registration process, choice filling, and subsequent seat allotment for various MD, MS, and PG Diploma courses.

The NEET PG counselling process is central to admissions for 50% All India Quota (AIQ) seats in government medical colleges and 100% of seats in Central Universities, Deemed Universities, ESIC, and Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) institutions. The third round, often a critical phase, serves to fill any remaining vacant seats from the previous two rounds, offering another opportunity for candidates who have not yet secured a preferred institution or specialization.

Candidates who are eligible and intend to participate in this round are advised to visit the MCC website immediately. The portal now hosts a direct link for registration and comprehensive details regarding the key dates. Strict adherence to the announced deadlines is imperative, as any delay could result in exclusion from the counselling process.

The schedule outlines several important phases for Round 3, which typically include:

*   **Fresh Registration:** Commencement of new registrations for eligible candidates who have not registered in previous rounds or wish to upgrade.
*   **Choice Filling and Locking:** A specific window during which registered candidates can select their preferred colleges and courses, followed by locking these choices.
*   **Seat Allotment Processing:** The period during which the MCC processes the choices and NEET PG 2025 ranks to allot seats.
*   **Publication of Results:** The official announcement of Round 3 seat allotment results on the MCC website.
*   **Reporting to Allotted Colleges:** A designated period for candidates to report to their assigned institutions for document verification and admission formalities.

The NEET PG counselling process is designed to ensure transparency and fairness in the allocation of postgraduate medical seats across the country. The MCC, operating under the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, plays a pivotal role in managing this complex admission procedure. The outcome of these counselling rounds directly impacts the future medical workforce and specialized healthcare services in India.

Aspirants are strongly encouraged to regularly check the mcc.nic.in portal for any updates, official notices, and the exact dates for each counselling activity. It is also recommended that candidates carefully review the information brochure and frequently asked questions (FAQs) available on the website to understand the rules and eligibility criteria pertaining to Round 3 of the counselling process. This round represents one of the final opportunities for securing admission through the centralized counselling system for the NEET PG 2025 academic session.
