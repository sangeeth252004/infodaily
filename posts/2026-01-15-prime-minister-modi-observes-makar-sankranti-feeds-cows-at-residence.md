Prime Minister Narendra Modi observed the Makar Sankranti festival on January 14, 2022, by feeding cows at his official residence in New Delhi. Visuals of the Prime Minister interacting with the cows and offering fodder were widely circulated across various media platforms, marking his participation in the traditional Hindu festival.

Makar Sankranti is an annual harvest festival celebrated across India, marking the sun's transition into the zodiac sign of Makara (Capricorn). This celestial event signifies the end of the winter solstice and the beginning of longer days, symbolizing new beginnings and prosperity. It is a day often dedicated to prayers, charity, and specific cultural practices depending on regional traditions.

The act of feeding cows, known as Gau Seva, holds significant cultural and religious importance within Hinduism. Cows are revered as sacred animals, symbolizing motherhood, sustenance, and abundance. Engaging in Gau Seva, particularly on auspicious occasions like Makar Sankranti, is considered an act of merit and devotion. Many devotees perform this ritual to express gratitude and seek blessings, linking the practice to well-being and prosperity.

The Prime Minister was seen gently stroking the cows and offering them fodder during the observance. This public act of adhering to traditional practices has been a consistent aspect of his public engagements, often highlighting India's cultural heritage and spiritual values. Such observances by public figures are frequently shared across social media and news outlets, drawing public attention to cultural practices.
