A Block Development Officer (BDO) office in Dinajpur, West Bengal, was reportedly vandalized while a Service at the Door (SIR) hearing was in progress. The incident, which marks the second such occurrence targeting a BDO office in the state, led to the immediate filing of a First Information Report (FIR) with local police. Authorities have initiated an investigation into the matter to identify the individuals responsible and ascertain the motive behind the disruption and damage.

The vandalism occurred during a session intended to provide public services and address grievances directly at the administrative block. While specific details regarding the extent of the damage are under assessment, the disruption forced the temporary halt of the ongoing public hearing. Such Service at the Door initiatives are designed to enhance accessibility and transparency in local governance by bringing administrative services closer to citizens, making the timing and location of this incident particularly notable.

This event in Dinajpur follows a similar incident of vandalism at another BDO office in West Bengal. The recurrence of such acts targeting government administrative facilities raises concerns regarding the security of public servants and infrastructure, as well as the uninterrupted delivery of essential services to the populace. Block Development Offices serve as critical hubs for implementing various government schemes, managing rural development projects, and maintaining local law and order through coordination with various departments.

Key details surrounding the incident include:
*   **Location:** Block Development Officer's office, Dinajpur district, West Bengal.
*   **Context:** Occurred during a scheduled Service at the Door (SIR) hearing.
*   **Legal Action:** An FIR has been formally registered by the authorities.
*   **Precedent:** This is the second reported incident of a BDO office being vandalized in West Bengal.

Local police officials have confirmed the registration of the FIR and stated that a comprehensive investigation is underway. Teams are reportedly collecting evidence, reviewing any available surveillance footage, and gathering testimonies from witnesses present during the hearing. The primary objectives of the investigation include identifying the perpetrators, understanding the sequence of events, and determining if the vandalism was an isolated act or connected to broader issues. Further updates are expected as the police probe progresses into the circumstances surrounding this disruption to public administration.
