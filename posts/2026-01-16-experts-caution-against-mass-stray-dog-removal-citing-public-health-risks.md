Public health experts and animal welfare organizations globally are issuing warnings regarding the practice of mass removal or culling of stray dog populations. They assert that such measures, often intended to mitigate public health concerns, can paradoxically worsen them by increasing the risk of rabies transmission and creating more unstable canine communities. This position underscores the argument for sustainable, humane strategies over temporary, reactive interventions.

The primary concern articulated by veterinary professionals and public health specialists centers on what is known as the "vacuum effect." When an established population of stray dogs is removed, either through culling or relocation, the vacated territory often attracts new, unsterilized, and unvaccinated dogs from surrounding areas. These new arrivals typically lack immunity to diseases like rabies, are often less socialized, and can be more challenging to manage, leading to a potential surge in unvaccinated animals and a higher risk of disease transmission to humans and other animals.

Furthermore, organized dog packs, even stray ones, can maintain a certain level of territorial stability. Their sudden removal disrupts this structure, leading to an influx of transient, unbonded individuals, which can make consistent health monitoring and population management efforts significantly more difficult. Experts highlight that efforts to control rabies and manage dog populations effectively require a long-term, systemic approach rather than episodic purges.

Advocates for humane dog population management point to the success of Animal Birth Control (ABC) programs, combined with mass vaccination, as a more effective and sustainable solution. These programs involve:

*   **Sterilization:** Surgical removal of reproductive organs to prevent breeding and gradually reduce the population over time.
*   **Vaccination:** Administering anti-rabies vaccines to a significant percentage of the dog population (typically 70% or more) to establish herd immunity.
*   **Identification:** Ear-notching or tagging of sterilized and vaccinated dogs to track progress and prevent repeat captures.
*   **Community Engagement:** Education and involvement of local communities in responsible pet ownership and reporting of unsterilized or sick animals.

Studies and field reports from various regions where ABC programs have been consistently implemented demonstrate a significant reduction in dog bite incidents and a decline in human rabies cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) have consistently endorsed vaccination and sterilization as the most effective and ethical methods for controlling rabies and managing stray dog populations.

The warnings from experts call for municipal bodies and local authorities to review their dog population management policies. They emphasize a shift away from short-term removal strategies towards evidence-based, humane methods that prioritize public health and animal welfare outcomes. Collaboration between government agencies, veterinary professionals, and non-governmental organizations is deemed crucial for the successful implementation of such sustainable programs, aimed at fostering healthier communities for both humans and animals.
