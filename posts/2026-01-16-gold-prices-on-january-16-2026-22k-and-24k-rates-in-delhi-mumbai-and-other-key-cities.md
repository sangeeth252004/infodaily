Gold prices across major Indian cities were updated on January 16, 2026, with variations observed for both 22-carat (22K) and 24-carat (24K) gold. Consumers and investors in metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai witnessed distinct rates for the precious metal, reflecting the dynamic nature of the market. These daily adjustments are crucial for individuals planning purchases or assessing investments in physical gold.

The daily fluctuation in gold prices is influenced by a confluence of global and domestic factors. International gold prices, which are determined by supply and demand, geopolitical events, and currency movements, play a significant role. Domestically, factors such as import duties, state taxes, and local market demand contribute to the final retail price in each city. The difference between 22K and 24K gold rates primarily stems from their purity; 24K gold is 99.9% pure, while 22K gold typically contains 91.6% gold mixed with other metals like copper or silver to enhance durability, making it suitable for jewellery.

Understanding these distinctions is vital for buyers, as 24K gold is typically preferred for investment purposes due to its higher purity, whereas 22K gold is the standard for most jewellery items. The rates provided by various market sources and official company announcements serve as a benchmark for transactions occurring throughout the day. Minor differences between cities can often be attributed to local taxes, transportation costs, and specific market conditions prevalent in those regions.
