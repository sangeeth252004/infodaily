New Delhi, India – Israeli Ambassador to India, Naor Gilon, joined prominent Indian leaders on March 23, 2022, in paying tribute to the nation's soldiers on the occasion of Shaheedi Diwas. Ambassador Gilon's remarks aligned with solemn observances by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, collectively commemorating the courage and sacrifice of Indian freedom fighters. This collective recognition underscored the significance of the day and highlighted diplomatic solidarity.

Ambassador Gilon conveyed his homage through a social media post, stating, "On #ShaheediDiwas, I pay my sincere respect and salute to the indomitable courage and sacrifice of Indian soldiers." He further underscored the universal value of freedom by quoting Mahatma Gandhi: "Freedom is never dear at any price. It is the breath of life. What would a man not pay for living?" This diplomatic gesture recognized the historical significance of the day for India and highlighted the respect shared between the two nations.

Concurrently, India's top leadership also issued tributes. President Ram Nath Kovind paid homage, acknowledging the profound sacrifices made by the nation's heroes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized that the sacrifices of these martyrs would continue to inspire generations of Indians.

Key details surrounding the observance and bilateral context include:
