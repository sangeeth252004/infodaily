Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) secured a comprehensive victory over Gujarat Giants by 75 runs on Sunday, March 23, 2026, at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. The win marks RCB's fifth consecutive triumph in the Women's Premier League (WPL) 2026 season, solidifying their position at the top of the league standings and extending their unbeaten run.

Electing to bat first after winning the toss, RCB posted a formidable total of 188 runs for the loss of 4 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Opener Smriti Mandhana led the charge with a commanding 78 runs off 49 deliveries, including 10 fours and 2 sixes. She was ably supported by Ellyse Perry, who contributed a brisk 45 runs from 28 balls. The partnership between Mandhana and Perry for the second wicket added 98 runs, setting a strong foundation for the innings. Gujarat Giants’ bowlers struggled to contain the flow of runs, with Ashleigh Gardner being the most effective, claiming 2 wickets for 32 runs.

In response, the Gujarat Giants' chase faltered early, as they lost key wickets in the powerplay. Their batting lineup struggled to build significant partnerships against a disciplined RCB bowling attack. Despite a valiant effort from Phoebe Litchfield, who scored 41 runs off 35 balls, and Harleen Deol with 28 runs, the Giants were eventually bowled out for 113 runs in 18.2 overs. Renuka Singh Thakur was the standout bowler for RCB, taking 3 wickets for 18 runs, effectively dismantling the opposition's middle order. Asha Sobhana also contributed significantly with 2 wickets for 22 runs, maintaining pressure throughout the innings.

The victory not only reinforced RCB's dominance in the tournament but also highlighted their consistent performance across both batting and bowling departments. For the Gujarat Giants, the defeat adds to their challenging campaign, as they now face increased pressure to secure crucial wins in their remaining fixtures to keep their playoff aspirations alive. The substantial margin of victory further boosts RCB's net run rate, a key factor in league standings.
