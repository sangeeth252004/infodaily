The Staff Selection Commission (SSC) officially commenced the self-slot booking process for candidates appearing in the Multi-Tasking (Non-Technical) Staff (MTS) and Havaldar (CBIC & CBN) Examination 2026. The crucial window opened on November 15, 2025, allowing eligible applicants to select their preferred examination date, time, and test city. This development was announced through an official notice published on the Commission's website, www.ssc.nic.in.

The self-slot booking mechanism is a standard procedure implemented by the SSC to enhance logistical efficiency and provide flexibility to candidates. It enables applicants to proactively secure a convenient slot for their Computer-Based Examination (CBE) from the available options. This process is mandatory for all candidates who have successfully completed their application for the MTS and Havaldar 2026 examinations within the stipulated deadlines. Failure to book a slot within the specified period may result in the candidate being allotted a slot arbitrarily or potentially being unable to appear for the examination.

The MTS and Havaldar examinations are pivotal recruitment drives for various central government ministries, departments, and offices across India. The Multi-Tasking Staff (MTS) roles are Group 'C' non-gazetted, non-ministerial positions, while Havaldar positions fall under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) and the Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN). The 2026 cycle is expected to attract millions of applicants, underscoring the significance of a streamlined examination process.

Key details regarding the slot booking and upcoming examination are as follows:

*   **Booking Window:** The self-slot booking portal will remain active from November 15, 2025, until November 30, 2025. Candidates are advised to complete the process well before the closing date to avoid last-minute technical difficulties.
*   **Official Website:** All booking activities must be conducted exclusively through the official SSC website, www.ssc.nic.in.
*   **Credentials Required:** Candidates will need their Registration Number and Password to log in to their candidate dashboard and access the slot booking interface.
