The Indian Ministry of Defence formally addressed its non-participation in a multinational BRICS naval exercise held off the coast of South Africa in March 2022. The decision, which drew attention among observers of international military cooperation, was attributed to scheduling conflicts and prior operational commitments. The drill, named "Mosi II," saw participation from naval units of Russia, China, and host nation South Africa, operating in the waters near Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal.

India’s absence from the joint maritime exercise was noted given its status as a founding member of the BRICS bloc, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. While India regularly engages in various bilateral and multilateral naval exercises globally, its decision to opt out of this particular BRICS-led drill prompted official clarification. A defence official reiterated that the Indian Navy’s deployment schedule is complex and planned well in advance, indicating that the timing of the BRICS exercise coincided with other pre-determined operational mandates. The official also emphasized that participation in military drills is determined by a country's operational priorities and strategic interests.

The "Mosi II" exercise, which commenced on March 21, 2022, was designed to foster interoperability among the participating navies in areas such as maritime security, anti-piracy operations, search and rescue, and disaster relief. Russian naval assets, including the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, and Chinese vessels, such as the Type 054A frigate Rizhao and the guided-missile destroyer Huainan, actively took part alongside South African Navy frigates and support ships. The drill underscored the growing defense collaboration among certain BRICS members, particularly between Russia, China, and South Africa.

India's Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Defence have consistently maintained that the nation's engagement in military exercises is guided by its strategic interests and operational readiness, without external pressure. The country has a robust schedule of naval engagements, including exercises with Quad partners (USA, Japan, Australia), as well as independent drills in the Indian Ocean region. The official stance emphasizes India's commitment to multilateralism and international maritime security, irrespective of participation in every single exercise organized by its partner blocs.

The decision not to participate in the BRICS naval drill, while explained as a logistical matter, also highlighted India's nuanced approach to its defence diplomacy. As a nation balancing relationships with various global powers, including its long-standing strategic partnership with Russia and its complex border dynamics with China, India frequently navigates a path of strategic autonomy in its foreign and defence policy. The Ministry of Defence's clarification aimed to provide transparency regarding the nation's operational choices, reaffirming its independent decision-making process concerning military engagements.

Looking ahead, India is expected to continue its participation in a diverse array of naval exercises that align with its strategic objectives and capacity-building priorities. The broader BRICS cooperation framework, encompassing economic, political, and security dialogues, remains a key platform for India, with decisions regarding specific military drills being evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to operational feasibility and national interest.
