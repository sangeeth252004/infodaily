The Indian Embassy in Iran has confirmed that several Indian crew members are currently detained in the Islamic Republic, stating the situation is now "subject to judicial process." Diplomatic channels are actively engaged, with the Embassy continuously pressing Iranian authorities for immediate consular access to the detained individuals to ascertain their well-being and provide necessary support.

The precise number of detained crew members and the specific charges against them have not been publicly disclosed by either Indian or Iranian authorities. However, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has affirmed its commitment to ensuring the welfare of its citizens abroad. The Embassy's statement underscores the formal legal framework now governing the detention, indicating that legal proceedings are underway in Iran.

Seeking consular access is a standard and critical component of international diplomatic protocol when citizens are detained in a foreign country. It allows embassy officials to visit the detainees, verify their condition, ensure they are being treated humanely, and facilitate legal assistance. This access is crucial for safeguarding the rights of the individuals and providing a direct line of communication between them, their families, and their home government.

*   **Ongoing Diplomatic Engagement:** The Indian Embassy in Tehran is in regular communication with Iranian officials, reiterating its request for consular access.
*   **Welfare Priority:** Ensuring the safety and welfare of the detained Indian nationals remains the paramount concern for the Indian government.
*   **Adherence to Legal Process:** The statement "subject to judicial process" indicates that Indian authorities are acknowledging and monitoring the legal steps being taken by Iran.
*   **Support for Nationals:** Efforts are focused on providing all possible assistance to the crew members, including facilitating legal counsel if required and keeping their families informed.

This incident is not isolated in the geopolitically sensitive Persian Gulf region, where maritime activity is high and international tensions can sometimes lead to the detention of foreign vessels or crew members. While the specific circumstances surrounding this particular detention remain unclear, India consistently advocates for the rights of its seafarers globally and works to resolve such situations through diplomatic means.

The Indian government, through its embassy, will continue to monitor the judicial process closely and press for early resolution and repatriation of its citizens. The focus remains on securing consular access as a primary step to understanding the full scope of the situation and planning subsequent actions in accordance with international law and bilateral agreements. Further updates are expected as diplomatic efforts progress and the judicial process unfolds in Iran.
