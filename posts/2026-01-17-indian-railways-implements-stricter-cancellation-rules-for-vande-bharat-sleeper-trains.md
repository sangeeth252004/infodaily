Indian Railways has implemented revised and stricter cancellation regulations for confirmed tickets booked on its Vande Bharat sleeper train services. The new policy, which came into effect following an official announcement in October 2022, notably includes a provision for no refund on tickets cancelled within eight hours of the train's scheduled departure. This move aims to enhance seat utilization and manage demand for the premium high-speed services more efficiently.

The updated rules represent a significant change for passengers opting for Vande Bharat sleeper trains, requiring more decisive booking and travel planning. Previously, general cancellation policies offered more flexibility closer to departure times for various train categories. The new framework specifically targets the premium services, aligning with efforts to optimize operational logistics and revenue.

Key details of the revised cancellation policy for Vande Bharat sleeper train tickets include:

*   **More than 48 hours before departure:** A cancellation charge of 25% of the fare will be deducted, subject to a minimum of ₹120 plus Goods and Services Tax (GST) per passenger.
*   **Between 48 hours and 12 hours before departure:** A flat 25% of the fare will be deducted as a cancellation charge.
*   **Between 12 hours and 8 hours before departure:** A 50% deduction of the fare will apply as a cancellation charge.
*   **Less than 8 hours before departure:** No refund will be issued for tickets cancelled during this window.

For passengers holding RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) or waitlisted tickets, the rules stipulate that no refund will be provided if the ticket is cancelled after 30 minutes before the scheduled departure of the train. Furthermore, Tatkal tickets, which are designed for urgent travel, generally remain non-refundable upon cancellation, with exceptions typically made only in specific scenarios such as train cancellation by the railway authority itself.

The implementation of these stricter rules for Vande Bharat sleeper trains underscores Indian Railways' focus on maximizing the availability of confirmed seats for genuine travelers and minimizing losses incurred due to late cancellations. The Vande Bharat series, known for its modern amenities and faster travel times, is a flagship initiative, and these regulations are part of a broader strategy to streamline its operations and service delivery. Passengers are advised to review the updated policy carefully when making bookings to avoid potential forfeiture of ticket fares.
