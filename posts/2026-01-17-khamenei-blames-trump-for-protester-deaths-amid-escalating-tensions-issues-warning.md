Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, publicly accused the United States and then-President Donald Trump of being responsible for recent unrest and the deaths of protesters within Iran, labeling the developments an "American plot." The remarks were made in a public address in Tehran in early January 2020, during a period of heightened geopolitical tension between Iran and the United States. Khamenei also issued a significant warning, promising "fierce revenge" for the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.

Khamenei's statements followed a series of critical events that intensified regional instability and strained international relations. These included widespread protests in Iran in November 2019 over fuel price increases, which resulted in numerous casualties. The situation escalated dramatically with the U.S. drone strike on January 3, 2020, that killed General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, an action Iran condemned as an act of state terrorism. In retaliation, Iran launched missile strikes on Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops on January 8, 2020. Hours later, Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran, initially denied by Iran but later admitted to have been accidentally shot down by Iranian forces, killing all 176 people aboard.

In his address, Khamenei explicitly detailed his accusations and warnings:
*   **Blame on the U.S.:** He characterized the United States as Iran's "sworn enemy" and described its officials as "wicked" and "devils," asserting that they sought to destabilize Iran through various means, including funding and inciting protests.
*   **Trump's Role:** Khamenei specifically implicated then-President Trump, stating that Trump had personally ordered the assassination of General Soleimani. He contended that the unrest and the subsequent deaths of Iranian citizens were part of a broader U.S. strategy to sow discord and undermine the Islamic Republic.
*   **Warning of Revenge:** The Supreme Leader declared that Iran's retaliatory missile strikes against U.S. targets in Iraq were merely a "slap in the face" and insufficient as retribution for Soleimani's death. He vowed "fierce revenge" for the general's killing, indicating further actions could be expected. He also called for national unity in the face of perceived external threats.
*   **Call for Unity:** Amid the domestic and international crises, Khamenei underscored the importance of Iranian solidarity against foreign adversaries and internal dissent that he attributed to external manipulation.

These pronouncements by Ayatollah Khamenei further exacerbated already strained relations between Tehran and Washington. International observers noted that the escalating rhetoric, coupled with military actions, increased the risk of broader conflict in the Middle East. The downing of Flight 752 added another layer of complexity, drawing international scrutiny and calls for accountability, alongside internal pressure on the Iranian government.

In the aftermath of these events, the international community urged de-escalation of tensions and transparency regarding the Flight 752 investigation. The geopolitical landscape remained highly volatile, with both the United States and Iran adopting firm stances, indicating continued uncertainty regarding the future trajectory of their relationship and regional stability.
