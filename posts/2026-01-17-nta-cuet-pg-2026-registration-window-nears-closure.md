New Delhi – The National Testing Agency (NTA) has issued an important notification regarding the Common University Entrance Test Postgraduate (CUET PG) 2026, confirming that the application window is scheduled to close shortly. Prospective students seeking admission to postgraduate courses at participating universities across India must complete their online registration process by the upcoming deadline, reportedly March 15, 2026, at 5:00 PM IST. The official NTA website, exams.nta.ac.in/CUET-PG/, remains the designated portal for submissions.

The CUET PG examination serves as a single window opportunity for candidates to gain entry into various postgraduate programs offered by Central and participating State, Deemed, and Private universities nationwide. This standardized test aims to streamline the admission process, providing a common platform for evaluation and reducing the need for multiple entrance exams. The imminent closure of the registration window emphasizes the urgency for all eligible candidates who have not yet applied to finalize their submissions to avoid missing the opportunity for the academic year 2026-27.

Eligibility criteria for CUET PG 2026 typically require candidates to hold a bachelor's degree from a recognized university. Specific program-wise eligibility, including minimum percentage requirements, is detailed in the information bulletin available on the NTA website. The application process involves multiple steps, including online registration, filling out the detailed application form, uploading necessary documents such as photographs and signatures in specified formats, and payment of the application fee. Fees vary based on the candidate's category, with concessions for SC/ST/PwBD categories, and can be paid online through various digital payment methods.

The CUET PG examination for the 2026 academic session is anticipated to be conducted as a Computer Based Test (CBT) in multiple shifts across various cities in India and abroad. The test structure generally comprises multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering general knowledge, language comprehension, and domain-specific subjects, depending on the chosen program. Candidates are advised to carefully review the syllabus for their respective subjects as outlined in the official information bulletin to prepare effectively. The NTA has historically provided detailed exam patterns and sample papers to assist candidates in their preparation.
