NEW DELHI – The National Testing Agency (NTA) officially released the admit cards for the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) – 2026 Session 1 on Tuesday, December 23, 2025. Candidates registered for the highly anticipated engineering entrance examination can now download their hall tickets from the designated official NTA websites, including jeemain.nta.ac.in. The release marks a crucial step for aspirants preparing for the first session of JEE Main 2026, scheduled to be conducted from January 24, 2026, to February 1, 2026, across various cities in India and abroad.

The JEE Main examination serves as a gateway for admissions to undergraduate engineering programs (B.E./B.Tech) at National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), other Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs), and state-funded universities and institutions. It also acts as the eligibility test for JEE (Advanced), which is required for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). The timely release of admit cards allows candidates sufficient time to review their exam details, plan their travel, and familiarize themselves with examination day guidelines. Approximately 1.2 million candidates are expected to appear for JEE Main 2026 Session 1.

Candidates are required to log in using their application number and date of birth to access their individual admit cards. The admit card is a mandatory document for entry into the examination hall and contains essential information about the candidate and the examination. It details the candidate's name, photograph, signature, roll number, examination date, shift, time, and the allotted exam center address. The NTA has advised candidates to meticulously verify all details on their admit card and contact the NTA Help Desk immediately in case of any discrepancies.

Key details regarding the JEE Main 2026 Session 1 Admit Card and Examination:

*   **Examination Dates:** January 24, 2026, to February 1, 2026.
*   **Examination Mode:** Computer-Based Test (CBT) for Paper 1 (B.E./B.Tech) and Paper 2A (B.Arch), while Paper 2B (B.Planning) is also CBT. The drawing test for B.Arch (Part III of Paper 2A) is conducted offline on an A4 size drawing sheet.
*   **Mandatory Documents:** Candidates must carry a printed copy of their admit card, a valid photo ID proof (Aadhaar Card, Passport, Driving License, PAN Card, Voter ID), and a passport-size photograph (to be affixed on the attendance sheet) to the examination center.
*   **Prohibited Items:** Electronic devices, communication devices, textual material (except for items allowed by NTA), and certain accessories are strictly prohibited inside the examination venue. Candidates are advised to refer to the detailed instructions on their admit card.

Following the conclusion of Session 1, the NTA is expected to release the provisional answer key, followed by an opportunity for candidates to challenge the key. The final answer key and results for JEE Main 2026 Session 1 will be declared thereafter. Details regarding JEE Main 2026 Session 2, typically held in April, are anticipated to be released by the NTA in due course.
