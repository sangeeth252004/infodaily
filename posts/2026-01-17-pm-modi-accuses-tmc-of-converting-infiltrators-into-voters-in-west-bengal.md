Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a public address in West Bengal on March 2, 2022, accused the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government of facilitating the process of converting "infiltrators into voters" within the state. Addressing a rally, PM Modi called for "Asli Poriborton," or "real change," in West Bengal, intensifying political rhetoric against the Mamata Banerjee-led administration.

The Prime Minister's remarks centered on allegations that the TMC government was enabling individuals who had entered India illegally to be registered on electoral rolls, thereby impacting the democratic process. He stated that this alleged practice was a significant threat to the state's demographics and electoral integrity, implying a deliberate strategy by the state government. The accusation was delivered amidst ongoing political campaigns and debates concerning citizenship and residency in the region.

*   **Key Allegation:** Conversion of "infiltrators into voters."
*   **Target:** The Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal.
*   **Call to Action:** "Asli Poriborton" (real change) for the state.
*   **Context:** Delivered during a political rally in West Bengal on March 2, 2022.

These statements underscore long-standing political tensions between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by PM Modi, and the TMC in West Bengal. The issue of infiltration, particularly across the porous border with Bangladesh, has been a contentious topic in the state's political landscape for decades. The BJP has consistently advocated for stricter border controls and the implementation of policies like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to address these concerns. PM Modi's recent comments connect these broader issues directly to the electoral practices allegedly orchestrated by the incumbent state government.

The Prime Minister's emphasis on "Asli Poriborton" signals a sustained push by the BJP to challenge the TMC's governance and leadership in West Bengal. This phrase has been a recurring theme in the BJP's campaigns, symbolizing a promise of fundamental improvements across various sectors, from law and order to economic development, and implicitly, electoral fairness. The allegations of voter manipulation through infiltration add another dimension to the competitive political environment, particularly as parties strategize for future elections.

The Trinamool Congress has yet to issue a comprehensive official response to these specific allegations from PM Modi regarding voter registration and infiltration at the time of this report. However, the party has consistently denied similar accusations in the past, often characterizing them as politically motivated attempts to destabilize the state government and communalize the electorate. The political discourse around these issues is expected to continue shaping the public debate in West Bengal, influencing voter perception and party strategies in the lead-up to subsequent electoral cycles.
