An encounter broke out between security forces and militants in the Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir in the early morning hours of October 23, 2023. The exchange of fire resulted in injuries to three Indian Army soldiers, who were subsequently airlifted to a military hospital for specialized medical care.

The incident occurred during a cordon and search operation launched by a joint team of the Indian Army, Jammu & Kashmir Police, and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in the dense forest area near Padyarna, within the Paddar region of Kishtwar. Security forces initiated the operation following specific intelligence inputs regarding the presence of militants in the remote mountainous terrain. As the search party advanced into the suspected area, they came under unprovoked fire from hidden militant positions, prompting a swift retaliation.

The three injured soldiers, identified as Havildar Ramesh Kumar, Naik Santosh Singh, and Sepoy Alok Sharma, sustained gunshot wounds during the initial phase of the gunfight. Their comrades immediately provided first aid before they were evacuated from the site. Given the rugged terrain and the urgency of their condition, a military helicopter was deployed to airlift the injured personnel to the Command Hospital in Udhampur, where their condition is currently reported as stable.

Following the initial exchange, reinforcements were rushed to the encounter site to tighten the cordon and prevent the militants from escaping. The operation remains ongoing, with security forces utilizing advanced surveillance equipment and specialized units to track and neutralize the militant group. Officials have not yet confirmed the number of militants involved or any casualties on the militant side.

Kishtwar, once a highly volatile region, has seen a significant improvement in its security situation over the past few years due to sustained counter-insurgency operations. However, sporadic attempts by militant groups to re-establish their presence in the district’s remote pockets continue to be reported. This latest encounter underscores the persistent challenges faced by security forces in maintaining peace and stability in the Union Territory.

Authorities have urged local residents to remain indoors and cooperate with the ongoing security operations. Further details are expected to be released as the operation progresses and the area is thoroughly sanitized. The commitment of security forces to counter terrorism and ensure the safety of citizens remains a top priority in the region.
