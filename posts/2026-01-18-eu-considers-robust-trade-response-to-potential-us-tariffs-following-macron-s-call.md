French President Emmanuel Macron has recently called on the European Union to prepare a robust response, dubbed a "trade bazooka," against potential new tariffs from the United States. His remarks, made in the context of anticipated shifts in U.S. trade policy, specifically advocated for the activation of the EU's anti-coercion instrument to counter economic pressures.

Macron's strong stance underscores growing concerns within European leadership regarding the implications of a potential return to protectionist trade policies by a future U.S. administration. The French President emphasized the necessity for Europe to adopt "the toughest possible measures" to safeguard its economic interests and maintain its sovereignty against any attempts at trade coercion.

The European Union's anti-coercion instrument (ACI), established at the end of 2022, is designed to provide the bloc with legal tools to defend itself against economic blackmail and unlawful trade practices by non-EU countries. Its activation would allow the EU to impose countermeasures, such as tariffs, import/export restrictions, or limits on access to its internal market, in response to deliberate economic pressure.

The call for strong action draws parallels to the previous U.S. administration under former President Donald Trump, which imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU in 2018, citing national security grounds. The EU responded at the time with retaliatory tariffs on a range of American products, including motorcycles, bourbon, and denim. This historical context highlights the potential for escalating trade disputes and their impact on transatlantic economic relations.

Further complicating the trade landscape is the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in 2022, which offers significant subsidies for green technologies produced in North America. European leaders have expressed concerns that these provisions could disadvantage EU companies and attract investment away from Europe, creating an uneven playing field. Macron's remarks are seen as part of a broader European effort to ensure fair competition and protect its industrial base.

Key details regarding EU trade defense:
*   **EU Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI):** This legal framework, operational since late 2022, enables the EU to retaliate against economic pressure from non-EU countries by imposing measures like tariffs, restrictions on services, or limits on investment.
*   **Previous Tariff Disputes:** In 2018, the Trump administration levied 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminum imports from the EU. The EU responded with reciprocal tariffs on approximately $2.8 billion worth of U.S. goods.
*   **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA):** A U.S. law providing substantial tax credits and subsidies for domestically produced green energy technologies. This policy has raised concerns among European nations regarding potential competitive disadvantages for their industries.

The debate over strengthening the EU's trade defense mechanisms is expected to intensify as the U.S. presidential election approaches. Any decision to activate the anti-coercion instrument or implement significant retaliatory measures would require broad consensus among EU member states. Observers will closely monitor diplomatic discussions and political developments on both sides of the Atlantic to gauge the future trajectory of transatlantic trade relations.
