Indian Railways has announced a new, more stringent cancellation policy for tickets booked on the upcoming Vande Bharat Sleeper train services. The revised rules, which include higher charges compared to existing train categories, are set to come into effect from October 1, 2024. This directive, officially communicated by the Railway Board on September 15, 2024, aims to manage the anticipated high demand for the premium service and discourage speculative bookings, thereby optimizing seat availability for genuine passengers.

The new policy signifies a notable shift in the approach to managing bookings for the high-demand Vande Bharat Sleeper trains, which are designed to offer a superior travel experience. Currently under manufacturing and expected to be progressively rolled out across key long-distance routes, these trains are anticipated to provide AC sleeper comfort with modern amenities. The higher cancellation fees are intended to reflect the premium nature of the service and align with strategies observed in other advanced transportation sectors globally.

Passengers canceling Vande Bharat Sleeper tickets will face a tiered system of deductions, with charges increasing significantly closer to the departure time. This structure is distinct from the cancellation policies applicable to general class tickets or even the existing Vande Bharat Chair Car services. The objective is to ensure that available berths are not blocked by multiple speculative bookings and can be reallocated efficiently to other travelers.

Key details of the new cancellation policy include:

*   **48 hours or more before departure:** A flat fee of Rs. 240 per passenger will be deducted. This is an increase compared to the Rs. 120-180 typically charged for premium AC classes in other trains.
*   **Between 12 and 48 hours before departure:** A charge equivalent to 25% of the ticket fare, subject to a minimum of Rs. 360, will be applicable.
*   **Between 4 and 12 hours before departure:** 50% of the ticket fare will be forfeited.
*   **Less than 4 hours before departure or after chart preparation:** No refund will be issued, aligning with policies for some other premium train services and certain airline tickets.

The implementation of these stricter rules is expected to impact travel planning for individuals and families opting for the Vande Bharat Sleeper. While it may reduce the flexibility associated with booking, railway officials indicate it is a necessary measure to ensure fair access and efficient operation of a highly anticipated service. The Railways anticipates the first Vande Bharat Sleeper prototypes to begin trials by early 2025, with commercial services following thereafter. These trains are designed to offer features such as improved berths, better insulation, and enhanced safety systems.

The new policy also addresses cases of partial cancellations and modifications, where charges will be calculated per passenger based on the revised fare for the remaining journey. For waitlisted tickets that remain unconfirmed, the existing administrative charges will apply, ensuring a minimal deduction. The official announcement highlighted that the detailed guidelines, including specific fare classes and their corresponding cancellation slabs, would be made available on the Indian Railways website and through authorized ticketing agents.

As Indian Railways prepares for the rollout of the Vande Bharat Sleeper fleet, passengers are advised to carefully review the updated cancellation terms before making their bookings. The new policy represents a strategic move to optimize the management of premium rail travel, with its full impact on passenger behavior and service utilization to be observed following its implementation.
