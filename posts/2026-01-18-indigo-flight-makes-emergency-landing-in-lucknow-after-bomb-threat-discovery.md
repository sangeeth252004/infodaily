An IndiGo flight operating from Delhi to Kolkata executed an emergency landing at Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow on Tuesday, March 15, 2022, following a credible bomb threat. The alert was initiated after a note, explicitly stating "bomb on board," was discovered written on a piece of toilet paper within one of the aircraft's lavatories. Flight 6E-2211, carrying 180 passengers and seven crew members, landed safely in Lucknow at approximately 12:20 PM local time, activating a full-scale airport emergency response.

The discovery of the handwritten note prompted the flight crew to immediately inform Air Traffic Control (ATC) and activate emergency protocols. The pilot was directed to divert the aircraft to the nearest suitable airport, which was Lucknow, to ensure the safety of all individuals onboard. Upon landing, the aircraft was guided to an isolated bay, a standard procedure designed to contain potential threats away from main terminal areas and other operational aircraft.

Passengers were subsequently deplaned through emergency exits, utilizing slides, and safely escorted to a secure area within the airport terminal. While initial reports indicated no injuries during the evacuation, the experience caused significant disruption and distress for those on board. Security agencies, including the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) and a specialized dog squad, immediately commenced a thorough inspection of the entire aircraft, including luggage and cargo compartments. This swift and coordinated response by airline staff, airport authorities, and security personnel underscores the rigorous safety measures in place for aviation security incidents.

The incident also led to a temporary disruption of operations at Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport, with some flights experiencing minor delays or adjustments during the security sweep. Such events highlight the substantial resources and coordination required to address potential threats to civil aviation, irrespective of their eventual validity.

Key factual details confirmed by authorities include:
*   **Airline and Flight Number:** IndiGo Airlines flight 6E-2211.
*   **Route:** Scheduled to fly from Delhi to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, Kolkata.
*   **Emergency Landing Location:** Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.
*   **Date and Time of Landing:** Tuesday, March 15, 2022, around 12:20 PM IST.
*   **Onboard Personnel:** 180 passengers and 7 crew members.
*   **Threat Origin:** Handwritten note found on toilet paper in an aircraft lavatory.
*   **Response Units:** Airport emergency services, Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS), and canine units.
*   **Evacuation Method:** Passengers deplaned using emergency slides.

Following an extensive and methodical search by the security teams, which lasted several hours, no explosive devices, suspicious materials, or any indication of a bomb were discovered on board IndiGo flight 6E-2211. Authorities subsequently declared the bomb threat a hoax. The aircraft was later cleared for further operations after being deemed safe. Law enforcement agencies have initiated a comprehensive investigation into the incident, aiming to identify the individual responsible for writing and placing the threatening note. Perpetrators of such hoaxes can face severe legal consequences under aviation security laws, as these actions cause widespread alarm, significant operational disruption, and divert critical security resources. The investigation is ongoing to trace the source of the false alarm and prevent similar occurrences.
