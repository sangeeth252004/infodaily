In August 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called on the European Union to prepare a robust, comprehensive response, metaphorically termed a "trade bazooka," against potential tariffs from the United States. Macron's remarks underscored the EU's determination to defend its economic interests amidst escalating trade tensions and a diplomatic disagreement concerning then-US President Donald Trump's suggestion to purchase Greenland.

President Macron's statement highlighted growing concerns within the EU regarding the trajectory of transatlantic trade relations. He specifically advocated for the activation of the EU's anti-coercion instrument, a tool designed to provide the bloc with legal avenues to retaliate against economic pressure from third countries. This call was part of a broader European effort to project unity and strength in the face of what some perceived as unilateral US trade policies.

Key details surrounding Macron's intervention include:
*   **Timing:** Macron made the comments during a press conference in August 2019, following a period of heightened trade friction between the EU and the US.
*   **Context:** The immediate backdrop included the cancellation of a planned state visit by President Trump to Denmark after its prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, dismissed Trump's interest in acquiring Greenland as "absurd." This diplomatic spat added to existing trade disagreements.
*   **Existing Tariffs:** The US had already imposed 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminum imports from the EU in 2018, citing national security grounds. The EU had responded with retaliatory tariffs on a range of US products.
*   **Threat of Auto Tariffs:** A significant concern for the EU was the persistent threat from the Trump administration to impose 25% tariffs on European automobile imports, which would have had a substantial impact on the European economy, particularly Germany.
*   **"Trade Bazooka" Concept:** This term, used by Macron, symbolized the desire for a swift, overwhelming, and coordinated European response rather than piecemeal retaliatory measures, indicating a readiness to escalate if necessary.

Macron emphasized that Europe should not be treated as a "vassal" and must stand firm to protect its sovereignty and economic autonomy. His stance reflected a broader sentiment within the EU that the bloc needed to develop more robust tools to counter economic coercion and protect its single market from external pressures.

While the immediate tensions surrounding the "Greenland row" eventually subsided, Macron's advocacy for stronger EU trade defense mechanisms proved significant. The discussions initiated during this period of transatlantic strain contributed to the eventual formal proposal and adoption of the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument. This instrument was formally proposed by the European Commission in December 2021 and entered into force in December 2022, providing the European Union with a concrete legal framework to respond to economic coercion by non-EU countries, reflecting the long-term impact of calls made during the 2019 trade disputes.
