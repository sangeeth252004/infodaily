Ebru Ozdemir, Chairwoman of Limak Group and a co-chair of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting, has emphasized that investing in women's employment is critical for establishing future-proof economies. The assertion was made during a panel discussion at the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, where leaders convened to address global economic challenges and opportunities for sustainable development. Her statements underscore the importance of integrating women fully into the workforce as a strategic imperative for long-term economic resilience and growth, a vision relevant to global economic discussions extending towards 2026 and beyond.

Ozdemir highlighted that increased participation of women in the economy is a significant driver for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, innovation, and overall societal well-being. She connected this economic empowerment to broader global challenges, including climate change, pandemics, and various conflicts, suggesting that robust and inclusive economies are better positioned to withstand such pressures. The discussion focused on how closing the gender gap is not merely a social justice issue but an economic necessity.

Concrete data and existing disparities were presented to illustrate the current landscape and the potential for improvement.
*   Over 1 billion women worldwide currently lack adequate digital access, hindering their ability to participate fully in modern economies.
*   Women hold only 27% of managerial positions globally, indicating a substantial underrepresentation in leadership roles.
*   Studies suggest that providing universal digital access for women could boost global GDP by an estimated $13 to $28 trillion.

Ozdemir cited her own organization’s initiative, the Limak Group’s "Engineer Girls of Turkey" project, as an example of private sector commitment to addressing these disparities. The project aims to encourage young women to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, thereby expanding their opportunities in high-demand sectors.

The dialogue at the WEF Annual Meeting also underlined the necessity of a multi-stakeholder approach to achieve gender parity in employment. This approach requires robust public-private collaboration, the implementation of targeted policies, and a concerted effort to enhance digital literacy among women. Developing inclusive workplaces that support women's career progression and leadership development was also identified as essential.

Further discussions involved the role of the Chief Diversity Officers' community in championing these changes within corporations. Recommendations included:
*   **Investing in foundational infrastructure:** Ensuring access to digital tools and reliable connectivity for women.
*   **Promoting digital literacy and upskilling:** Equipping women with the necessary skills for digital-first economies.
*   **Facilitating access to leadership roles:** Creating pathways for women to ascend to managerial and executive positions.

The call to action from the WEF Annual Meeting underscores an ongoing commitment to fostering an inclusive global economy. Stakeholders are expected to continue advocating for policies and initiatives that prioritize women's economic empowerment, aiming to realize the substantial untapped potential for global growth and stability. These discussions lay groundwork for future economic forums and policy considerations as the international community works towards a more equitable and resilient global economic landscape.
