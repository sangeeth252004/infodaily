On March 22, 2022, an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) was detected on the Srinagar-Baramulla highway in Jammu and Kashmir. The timely discovery by a joint team of security forces led to the subsequent safe destruction of the device by a specialized bomb disposal squad. This operation successfully averted a potential major security incident along a critical arterial route in the region, preventing possible harm to commuters and security personnel.

The IED was located near the Baramulla bypass, a significant stretch of the highway that connects the capital city of Srinagar with Baramulla district and other northern areas of the Kashmir Valley. Security personnel, comprising a joint team of the Army’s 2 Rashtriya Rifles and the Jammu and Kashmir Police, identified the suspicious package during a routine area domination patrol. Upon detection, authorities immediately cordoned off the section of the highway to ensure public safety and prevent any potential casualties. Traffic movement was halted on both sides of the affected stretch, causing temporary disruption for commuters and local residents.

Following the establishment of a secure perimeter, a specialized bomb disposal squad was promptly called to the scene. Experts from the squad meticulously examined the device and confirmed it to be an active IED. The explosive device was estimated to weigh approximately five kilograms and was reportedly fitted with a detonator and other components, indicating its operational readiness. Given the nature of the device and the potential for severe damage, the squad opted for a controlled explosion to neutralize the threat. The IED was safely detonated in an isolated area, causing no collateral damage or injuries. After the successful destruction operation, the security forces conducted a thorough sanitization of the area to ensure no further threats existed before reopening the highway to traffic.
