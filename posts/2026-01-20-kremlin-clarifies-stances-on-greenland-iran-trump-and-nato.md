Moscow, October 19, 2022 – Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov delivered comprehensive remarks addressing Russia’s official positions on several prominent international issues, including Greenland, collaborative projects with Iran, U.S. foreign policy under former President Donald Trump, and the expansion of NATO. During a regular press briefing, Peskov stated unequivocally that Russia holds "no interest in Greenland," directly addressing persistent geopolitical speculation.

Regarding Greenland, a large, self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, Peskov firmly asserted that any discussions pertaining to its sovereignty or future are "not a Russian topic." This declaration serves to clarify Moscow's position amidst a backdrop of increasing strategic interest in the Arctic region. Global powers have shown heightened attention to the Arctic due to its vast natural resources and evolving shipping routes, leading to various analyses and discussions about regional influence. Peskov's statement indirectly countered past media reports and geopolitical analyses that have sometimes linked Russia to broader ambitions concerning the territory, including a notable instance in 2019 when former U.S. President Donald Trump publicly expressed interest in purchasing Greenland, a proposition swiftly rejected by Danish authorities.

Addressing Russia’s engagement with Iran, Mr. Peskov reaffirmed Moscow's unwavering commitment to continuing its collaborative projects with the Islamic Republic. He emphasized that all such initiatives would proceed in strict adherence to "international law" and existing bilateral agreements. This position is particularly relevant given ongoing international pressure and sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran, which often urge other nations to curtail their economic and strategic cooperation. Russia and Iran maintain significant partnerships across various sectors, including energy, trade, and defense, which both nations assert are legitimate under established international frameworks.

Peskov also offered insights into the dynamics of U.S.-Russia relations during the presidency of Donald Trump. He characterized these relations as consistently "complex," despite some initial public and media speculation that a Trump administration might foster improved ties with Moscow. Peskov highlighted that fundamental disagreements, notably regarding the situation in Ukraine and the eastward expansion of NATO, remained points of friction throughout Trump's term. He reiterated that while there were initial expectations of a potential reset in bilateral relations, the underlying geopolitical divergences persisted, leading to continued challenges in the relationship.

On the subject of NATO, the Kremlin spokesperson reiterated Russia's long-standing concerns regarding the military alliance's continuous expansion. Mr. Peskov underscored Russia's consistent view that the growth of NATO, particularly towards its borders, constitutes a direct threat to Moscow's security interests. This stance has been a cornerstone of Russia's foreign policy for decades and is frequently cited in discussions surrounding European security architecture and regional stability, particularly in the context of recent geopolitical developments.

These official statements from the Kremlin collectively delineate Russia's current diplomatic and strategic priorities across a range of sensitive global dossiers. The pronouncements are expected to be closely monitored by international policymakers, analysts, and foreign governments as they seek to understand Moscow's strategic direction and potential implications for global stability and various international relationships.
