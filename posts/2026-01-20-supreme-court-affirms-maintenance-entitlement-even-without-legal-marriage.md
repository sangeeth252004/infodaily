New Delhi – The Supreme Court of India recently delivered a significant ruling, asserting that a woman can seek financial maintenance from her partner even if their marriage was not legally valid or never formally existed. This landmark decision, delivered on [e.g., April 19, 2022, or simply "recently"], broadens the scope of protective laws, emphasizing the judiciary's role in preventing destitution, particularly for women who have cohabited in relationships resembling marriage.

The ruling clarifies and expands the application of existing maintenance provisions under Indian law, moving beyond the strict legalistic confines of a fully recognized marriage. The Court underscored that the fundamental objective of maintenance provisions, specifically Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA), is to ensure that an economically vulnerable party, often a woman, is not left without financial support upon separation, even if the marriage is subsequently found to be void or invalid.

*   **Key Interpretations:**
    *   The bench elucidated that the term "wife" under Section 125 of the CrPC should be interpreted expansively. It includes women who have been in a domestic relationship "in the nature of marriage," irrespective of whether all technical legal requirements for a valid marriage were strictly fulfilled.
    *   The judgment drew upon previous precedents, including the 2013 ruling in *Indra Sarma vs. V.K.V. Sarma*, which established guidelines for identifying relationships that qualify as "in the nature of marriage."
    *   Furthermore, the PWDVA's broader definitions of "domestic relationship" and "aggrieved person" were highlighted as crucial instruments offering a wider net of protection to women in non-marital cohabitation arrangements.

This judicial pronouncement often arises from cases where women, after years of cohabitation and emotional investment, are deserted from relationships that are later discovered to be legally void due to various impediments, such as a prior undissolved marriage (bigamy) or entry into prohibited degrees of relationship. The Supreme Court's decision aims to prevent such women from being denied economic support on mere technical grounds, recognizing the social realities and the often unequal economic position of women in such relationships. The judgment seeks to ensure that significant personal sacrifices made during a relationship are acknowledged, and women are not left in a precarious financial state.

The bench, typically a division bench in such cases, reiterated that to deny maintenance in these circumstances would amount to a miscarriage of justice. Such an approach would leave women, who may have dedicated years to a household or partner, without any means of sustenance. The ruling firmly reinforces the principle that individuals in relationships bearing the hallmarks of marriage, regardless of their formal legal status, should not be abandoned without adequate means of support.

This judgment is poised to significantly influence family law jurisprudence in India, particularly in cases involving:
*   **Live-in Relationships:** Women in long-term live-in relationships, provided they meet the established criteria of a "relationship in the nature of marriage," are now more strongly positioned to seek maintenance.
*   **Void or Voidable Marriages:** Women whose marriages are legally declared void ab initio (from the beginning) due to legal impediments will retain their entitlement to financial support.
*   **Enhanced Protection Against Destitution:** The ruling strengthens the existing safety net for women who are frequently economically dependent on their partners and face severe hardship upon separation.

The Supreme Court's stance represents a progressive stride towards ensuring social justice and promoting gender equality within India's evolving social landscape. It signals a judicial readiness to adapt legal interpretations to contemporary societal realities, thereby ensuring that the protective spirit of laws prevails over strict legal formalism. The principles outlined in this ruling are expected to guide lower courts in their adjudication of diverse domestic disputes in the coming years.
