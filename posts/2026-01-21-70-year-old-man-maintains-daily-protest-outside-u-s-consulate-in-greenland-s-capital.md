Nuuk, Greenland – Jens Kjeldsen, a 70-year-old former journalist and fisherman, has been conducting a daily, solitary protest outside the United States Consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, for over a year. Standing in sub-zero temperatures, Kjeldsen's demonstration targets what he describes as the United States' historical exploitation of Greenland and demands the return of land he claims was "stolen."

Kjeldsen's core grievance centers on a World War II-era land lease and the continued American presence in Greenland, particularly referencing the Thule Air Base. He contends that the lease is illegal and that the United States has exploited Greenlandic resources and land for decades. His handmade signs, typically displayed during his protest, carry messages such as "USA return stolen land" and "USA go home," reflecting his belief that the U.S. continues to occupy parts of Greenland. Kjeldsen has publicly stated his view that Greenlandic politicians have not been sufficiently assertive in challenging the United States on these issues.

The daily protest typically takes place for approximately one to one and a half hours each morning, regardless of the weather conditions. Temperatures in Nuuk during these times can often drop to between -10 and -20 degrees Celsius. Kjeldsen, a native of Nuuk, has reportedly engaged in various forms of activism throughout his life, addressing issues ranging from environmental concerns to indigenous rights. His current demonstration, though solitary, occasionally draws interactions from passersby in the Greenlandic capital.

The United States officially re-established its consulate in Nuuk in June 2020, following an almost 70-year absence. This move was part of a broader U.S. strategy to enhance its diplomatic and economic engagement in the Arctic region, emphasizing partnerships with Arctic nations like Denmark and its autonomous territories, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The consulate serves as a point of contact for bilateral relations, commerce, and cultural exchange.

While the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, which oversees the Nuuk consulate, has not issued a direct comment regarding Kjeldsen's specific protest, it has consistently reiterated the United States' commitment to fostering a strong and respectful relationship with Greenland. Kjeldsen has expressed his intention to continue his daily vigil, maintaining his call for the United States to address his concerns regarding historical land agreements and its presence in the region.
