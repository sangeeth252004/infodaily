Dubai, UAE – The Dubai Gold & Jewellery Group (DGJG) announced this week the release of its comprehensive market analysis report, projecting a significant increase in gold prices in Dubai by 2026. The report forecasts that gold prices are expected to reach unprecedented record highs, with an anticipated surge of Dh50 per gram compared to current market values.

This projection underscores the continuing appeal of gold as a safe-haven asset amidst global economic volatility. According to the DGJG's findings, the price of 24-karat gold in Dubai is expected to surpass previous benchmarks, potentially exceeding Dh295 per gram, up from an average of Dh245 per gram recorded earlier this month. This projected Dh50 per gram increase represents a substantial percentage climb, reinforcing the precious metal's status in the investment landscape.

The DGJG report attributes this anticipated surge to several interconnected global and regional factors:
*   **Persistent Global Economic Uncertainty:** Ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic instability across major markets are expected to drive investors towards tangible assets.
*   **Inflationary Pressures:** Continued global inflation is prompting investors to seek hedges against currency devaluation, with gold historically serving this role.
*   **Increased Central Bank Demand:** Central banks worldwide are projected to continue their accumulation of gold reserves, bolstering institutional demand.
*   **Rising Retail and Institutional Investor Interest:** Heightened interest from both individual and institutional investors in precious metals is expected to persist.
*   **Supply Dynamics:** Potential shifts in global gold production and supply chains could also contribute to price appreciation.

Dubai's strategic position as a leading global gold trading hub is expected to be further reinforced by these market trends. The report suggests potential shifts in consumer purchasing patterns within the local jewellery sector as prices ascend, encouraging industry stakeholders to adapt their strategies. Dubai's well-established infrastructure and robust regulatory framework continue to support its prominence in the international gold trade.

Key details from the DGJG report include:
*   **Current Average 24-Karat Gold Price:** Approximately Dh245 per gram (as of early October 2023).
*   **Projected 24-Karat Gold Price by 2026:** Expected to exceed Dh295 per gram.
*   **Previous Record High:** The report notes the previous record high for 24-karat gold in Dubai was approximately Dh230 per gram, observed in August 2020.
*   **Analysis Methodology:** The DGJG's analysis incorporates global economic indicators, detailed supply-demand dynamics, and investor sentiment indices.

Market analysts reviewing the DGJG report emphasize the need for continued monitoring of global economic developments and their potential impact on commodity markets. While the report provides a detailed outlook, it advises stakeholders to remain vigilant to external factors that could influence price trajectories. The DGJG reiterated its commitment to providing comprehensive market insights to support the stability and growth of the gold industry in Dubai and the wider region.
