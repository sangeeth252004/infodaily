Reports emerging from financial circles indicate that the Indian government is exploring a significant simplification of the income tax structure under the new tax regime, with discussions focusing on reducing the number of existing tax slabs. This potential reform, which could be introduced ahead of Budget 2026, aims to streamline the taxation process, possibly drawing inspiration from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) model's fewer rate categories. The objective is to enhance taxpayer convenience and promote broader adoption of the new, concessional tax regime.

The current new tax regime, introduced in Budget 2020, offers lower tax rates in exchange for foregoing certain exemptions and deductions available under the old regime. While it has been modified to include five slabs and a basic exemption limit of ₹3 lakh in recent budgets, its adoption has been slower than anticipated. Policy makers are reportedly reviewing measures to make it more appealing and easier to navigate for taxpayers. Simplification of slabs is seen as a key step in this direction, reducing complexity often associated with multiple tax brackets.

The concept of a "GST-style" structure implies moving from the existing five or six slabs to a significantly lower number, possibly three or four. Such a transition would aim to provide clearer tax liability calculations, potentially reducing errors and the need for professional assistance for a segment of taxpayers. The government's push for a simplified, transparent tax system has been a consistent theme across various reforms, including the implementation of GST itself.

Key considerations underpinning this potential reform include:

*   **Enhancing Taxpayer Convenience:** Fewer slabs could make it easier for individuals to understand and comply with tax regulations.
*   **Boosting New Regime Adoption:** A more straightforward structure might incentivize more taxpayers to opt for the new regime, thereby rationalizing the overall tax system.
*   **Reducing Administrative Burden:** A simplified system could also ease the administrative load on the tax authorities.
*   **Aligning with Global Best Practices:** Many developed economies operate with fewer income tax brackets, favoring simplicity and ease of administration.

While specific details regarding the proposed number of slabs or their corresponding rates have not been officially disclosed, discussions within government and policy think tanks are understood to be assessing various models. The new income tax regime currently features rates ranging from 5% to 30%, applicable across five slabs starting from ₹3 lakh. Any revision would likely involve adjusting these thresholds and rates to ensure revenue neutrality and maintain fairness across income groups.

As the nation approaches Budget 2026, these discussions are expected to gain further momentum. Any definitive proposals regarding changes to the income tax slab structure under the new regime will require formal announcement by the Ministry of Finance, typically during the Union Budget presentation. Until then, these remain considerations within ongoing efforts to refine India's direct tax framework.
