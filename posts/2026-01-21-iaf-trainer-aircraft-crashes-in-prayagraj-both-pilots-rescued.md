An Indian Air Force (IAF) Hawk Mk-132 advanced jet trainer aircraft crashed in an agricultural field near Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, on Tuesday morning, March 15, 2022. Both pilots on board successfully ejected from the aircraft before impact and were subsequently rescued with minor injuries.

The incident occurred at approximately 8:30 AM in the Parsaram-Pura Mufi area, situated roughly 30 kilometers from Prayagraj city. The aircraft, a British-designed BAE Systems Hawk built under license by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), was reportedly on a routine training sortie when it experienced a suspected technical malfunction. Initial reports from IAF officials indicated a mechanical failure as the probable cause, prompting the pilots to initiate the emergency ejection procedure.

Upon ejection, the two pilots parachuted to safety in the vicinity of the crash site. Local villagers and police officials were among the first responders, assisting the pilots immediately after their landing. IAF rescue teams arrived shortly thereafter, transporting both pilots to a military hospital for comprehensive medical examination and observation. Authorities confirmed that the pilots sustained only minor injuries and were in stable condition.

The Hawk Mk-132 sustained significant damage upon crashing into the soft ground adjacent to a pond. Fortunately, the crash occurred in an open agricultural area, preventing any casualties or damage to civilian property on the ground. The quick thinking of the pilots to guide the aircraft away from populated zones before ejecting is credited with averting a potentially more severe outcome.

Following the incident, the Indian Air Force promptly ordered a Court of Inquiry. This standard procedure is implemented for all military aircraft accidents to thoroughly investigate the circumstances leading to the crash. The inquiry panel will examine various factors, including flight data recorders, pilot testimonies, maintenance records of the aircraft, and environmental conditions at the time of the flight. The objective is to ascertain the precise cause of the malfunction and recommend measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

The Hawk Mk-132 advanced jet trainer is a crucial asset in the IAF's pilot training regimen. It serves as a vital bridge for pilots transitioning from basic trainers to advanced fighter aircraft, providing them with experience in high-performance jet flying and tactical training. The IAF operates a substantial fleet of these trainers, integral to maintaining its operational readiness and combat capabilities.

As the Court of Inquiry progresses, further details regarding the specific technical issue and the findings of the investigation are expected to be released. Until the inquiry concludes, operational specifics related to the individual aircraft and the training flight will remain part of the ongoing investigation.
