New Delhi – India's Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) is reportedly considering a significant change to driving regulations that could lead to the suspension or permanent cancellation of driving licenses for individuals accumulating five or more traffic offences within a single year. The proposed measure aims to enhance road safety and enforce greater discipline among motorists nationwide.

The initiative comes amidst ongoing efforts to reduce road fatalities and accidents across India. Data indicates a substantial number of road accidents annually, often attributed to traffic rule violations. The contemplated policy seeks to introduce a more stringent penalty system for repeat offenders, moving beyond monetary fines to impact driving privileges directly.

Key details of the proposed regulation indicate:
*   **Threshold:** A driver accumulating five recorded traffic violations within a 12-month period would face penalties affecting their license.
*   **Consequence:** Penalties could range from temporary suspension for a specified duration to permanent cancellation of the driving license, depending on the severity and nature of the offences.
*   **Objective:** The primary goal is to deter habitual offenders and promote safer driving practices, thereby contributing to a reduction in road accidents and fatalities.

This potential policy represents a shift towards a more point-based or cumulative offence system, common in various countries globally. It intends to target a broad spectrum of common traffic violations, including but not limited to:
*   Overspeeding
*   Jumping red lights
*   Driving under the influence (DUI)
*   Using mobile phones while driving
*   Improper lane changes
*   Not wearing a seatbelt or helmet

The current Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, along with its subsequent amendments, already provides for penalties for various traffic offences. However, the new proposal would introduce a cumulative threshold that triggers more severe administrative action against a driver's license itself, rather than just imposing individual fines for each offence. This approach is expected to act as a stronger deterrent, particularly for those who habitually disregard traffic laws.

While specific timelines for the implementation of these new rules have not been formally announced, the proposal is understood to be under active consideration by MoRTH. Stakeholder consultations and a formal legislative process would likely precede any final notification. If enacted, this policy would represent a substantial step in India's ongoing efforts to improve road safety metrics and foster a more responsible driving culture. The move is anticipated to be a key component in the broader strategy to achieve a significant reduction in road accidents and related casualties across the country.
