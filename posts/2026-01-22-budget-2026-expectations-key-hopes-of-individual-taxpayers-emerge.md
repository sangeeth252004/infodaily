As the Union Government prepares for the presentation of Budget 2026, individual taxpayers and various economic bodies have begun to articulate their key expectations for the upcoming fiscal plan. These proposals often aim to alleviate financial burdens, encourage savings, and address the rising cost of living. Discussions among financial analysts and taxpayer advocacy groups are highlighting four primary areas where individual taxpayers are hoping for relief and reform.

The anticipation surrounding Budget 2026 centers on potential adjustments to the personal income tax framework. Individual taxpayers, through various forums, are advocating for measures that could directly impact their disposable income and long-term financial planning. The government's economic strategy is expected to consider these appeals while balancing fiscal prudence and growth objectives.

Four key expectations frequently cited by individual taxpayers include:

*   **Revision of Income Tax Slabs and Rates:** Taxpayer associations are consistently advocating for an upward revision of the basic income tax exemption limit. Currently, the basic exemption limit stands at ₹2.5 lakh for individuals below 60 years under the old tax regime. Proponents suggest increasing this limit to ₹5 lakh, arguing it would provide substantial relief to lower and middle-income groups, aligning with inflationary trends and increasing the purchasing power of a larger segment of the population. There are also calls for a rationalization of existing tax slabs to reduce the tax burden at various income levels, potentially reducing the rates in the lower and middle-income brackets.

*   **Increase in Standard Deduction:** Salaried individuals are hoping for an increase in the standard deduction, which is currently set at ₹50,000. This deduction was reintroduced in Budget 2018 in lieu of medical and transport allowances. Taxpayer groups propose raising this limit to ₹75,000 or even ₹1 lakh. They contend that such an increase is necessary to account for the consistent rise in professional expenses and the overall cost of living, thereby offering more disposable income to salaried employees.

*   **Enhancement of Section 80C and 80D Limits:** A significant demand revolves around increasing the deduction limits under Section 80C and Section 80D of the Income Tax Act. Section 80C, which covers various investments like provident funds, life insurance premiums, and home loan principal repayments, currently has a limit of ₹1.5 lakh. Many argue this limit, last revised in 2014, is insufficient given current investment costs and inflation. Proposals suggest raising it to ₹2.5 lakh or ₹3 lakh to encourage long-term savings and investments. Similarly, for Section 80D, which provides deductions for health insurance premiums, an increase from the current ₹25,000 (for individuals below 60) is sought, recognizing the escalating costs of healthcare.

*   **Inflation-Adjusted Relief and Deductions:** With persistent inflationary pressures impacting household budgets, there is a strong appeal for various deductions and exemptions to be indexed to inflation. This includes, but is not limited to, the interest deduction on housing loans under Section 24, which is capped at ₹2 lakh for self-occupied property. Taxpayers and real estate bodies are pushing for an upward revision of this limit, arguing that the current cap does not reflect present-day home loan interest burdens, especially in major urban centers. Adjusting such limits periodically would provide consistent relief against the eroding effect of inflation on real income.

The government is expected to present Budget 2026 in February 2026. The final proposals will be subject to the government's broader economic outlook, fiscal policy objectives, and the prevailing financial landscape. Taxpayers will closely monitor the budget announcement for any measures that impact their personal finances and investment decisions.
