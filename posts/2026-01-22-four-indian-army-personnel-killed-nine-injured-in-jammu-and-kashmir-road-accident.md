Four Indian Army personnel died and nine others sustained injuries when their vehicle plunged into a 200-foot gorge in Jammu and Kashmir's Shopian district on Wednesday morning, April 20, 2022. The accident occurred on the challenging Mughal Road near Pir Ki Gali, a high-altitude mountain pass in the region.

The incident involved an Indian Army vehicle, reportedly a troop carrier, transporting 13 personnel from the Rajouri district towards Shopian. Initial reports from authorities suggest the driver lost control of the vehicle while navigating a blind curve on the demanding terrain, causing it to fall into the deep gorge.

Following the accident, a rapid rescue operation was initiated. Teams from the Indian Army, local police, and civilian residents collaborated to extract the personnel from the wreckage. All injured individuals were immediately transported to the District Hospital Shopian for initial medical attention. Due to the severity of their injuries, several personnel were subsequently airlifted to the Army Base Hospital in Srinagar for specialized treatment.

The Mughal Road, where the accident took place, is a critical artery connecting Shopian in south Kashmir with Poonch and Rajouri in the Jammu region. It serves as an important alternative route to the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway and is frequently utilized for the movement of military convoys and civilian traffic. The road is known for its steep gradients, sharp turns, and challenging weather conditions, particularly at higher altitudes like Pir Ki Gali.

Further updates are anticipated as the investigation progresses.
