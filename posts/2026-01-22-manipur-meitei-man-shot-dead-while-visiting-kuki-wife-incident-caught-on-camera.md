A Meitei man, Laishram Kirankumar Singh, was shot dead by suspected Kuki militants on December 27, 2023, in Manipur's Kangpokpi district. The incident, which occurred while Singh was visiting his Kuki wife and child, was captured on a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera. The footage has recently circulated widely, drawing renewed attention to the ongoing ethnic violence in the northeastern Indian state.

The victim, a resident of Moirang in Bishnupur district, had reportedly gone to visit his wife, whom he had married in October 2022, and their child in Kangpokpi district, an area largely inhabited by the Kuki-Zo community. According to reports, Singh was ambushed and killed by multiple assailants. The CCTV footage shows the man being stopped, accosted, and then shot by individuals identified as suspected Kuki militants. The precise circumstances leading to his presence in Kangpokpi at the time of the incident are under investigation.

The killing underscores the deeply entrenched ethnic divisions and violence that have gripped Manipur since May 2023, primarily between the majority Meitei community and the Kuki-Zo tribal community. The incident is particularly notable due to the victim's inter-community marriage, highlighting how the conflict has affected individuals crossing ethnic lines. His death has been condemned by various groups, who view it as a grave act of violence exacerbating existing tensions.

Following the circulation of the graphic video, the Committee on Human Rights, Manipur (COHR) issued a strong condemnation, calling for swift justice and action against the perpetrators. The COHR highlighted the brutality of the act and demanded that law enforcement agencies identify and apprehend those responsible for Singh's death. They also emphasized the urgent need to address the root causes of the conflict and ensure the safety of all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic background.
