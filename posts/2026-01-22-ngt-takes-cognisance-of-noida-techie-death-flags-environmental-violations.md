The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has taken suo motu cognisance of the drowning death of a tech professional in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, recently. The principal bench of the NGT initiated proceedings on its own accord, flagging potential environmental violations and deficiencies in safety measures at the site of the incident. This move follows the tragic death of Rohit Singh, 26, who drowned in an illegally dug pit near Sector 94 in Noida.

The NGT's intervention underscores a broader concern regarding unauthorised construction activities, illegal mining, and the resulting environmental degradation in the region. The tribunal highlighted that the presence of an unprotected, water-filled pit, allegedly created through illegal excavation, directly contributed to the fatal incident. Such pits not only pose severe risks to public safety but also indicate flagrant disregard for environmental regulations designed to protect natural resources and human life.

Key details regarding the NGT's directives and concerns include:
*   **Incident Location:** The drowning occurred in a water-filled pit near Sector 94, Noida, an area reportedly prone to illegal sand mining and excavation activities.
*   **Suo Motu Action:** The NGT's decision to take cognisance was based on media reports detailing the incident and the suspected environmental negligence. This allows the tribunal to address issues of public importance without awaiting a formal petition.
*   **Environmental Violations:** The tribunal specifically noted the potential for unscientific excavation, lack of proper construction protocols, and failure to restore environmental balance after such activities.
*   **Safety Lapses:** The absence of fencing, warning signs, or other safety precautions around the dangerous pit was a significant factor in the NGT's assessment.

The NGT has constituted a joint committee to investigate the matter thoroughly. This committee comprises representatives from several key authorities, including the District Magistrate of Gautam Buddh Nagar, the Noida Authority, the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), and the Department of Mining. The committee has been tasked with conducting an on-site inspection, identifying the parties responsible for the illegal excavation and subsequent environmental damage, and assessing the extent of environmental non-compliance.

Furthermore, the NGT has directed the committee to submit a comprehensive report detailing its findings, along with recommendations for remedial actions and measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. The report is expected to outline the specific violations of environmental laws, identify any official negligence, and propose penalties or actions against those found responsible. This development signals a heightened scrutiny of urban development projects and resource extraction activities in the National Capital Region, emphasizing accountability for environmental and public safety standards.
