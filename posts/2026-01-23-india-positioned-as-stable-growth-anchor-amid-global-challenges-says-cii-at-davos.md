DAVOS, SWITZERLAND – The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) announced during the recent World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, that India is positioned as a stable growth anchor amidst prevailing global economic uncertainties. This assessment, presented by top Indian industry leaders and government representatives, emphasized India's resilience and potential to contribute significantly to global economic stability.

The pronouncement comes as the global economy navigates a complex landscape marked by geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and supply chain disruptions. In this context, the CII highlighted India’s strong fundamentals, including robust domestic consumption, sustained investment, and ongoing structural reforms, as key drivers of its economic stability. Delegations from India, comprising business executives and government officials, engaged extensively with international investors and policymakers to articulate the country's economic narrative and explore collaboration opportunities.

Key factors contributing to India’s projected role as a growth anchor, according to CII statements at Davos, included:

*   **Robust GDP Growth Projections:** India's economy has demonstrated consistent growth, with organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting it to remain among the fastest-growing major economies globally. The CII reiterated confidence in India’s ability to sustain a growth rate of approximately 6.5-7% in the coming fiscal year, driven by both public and private sector expenditure.
*   **Strengthening Domestic Demand:** A large and growing domestic market provides a significant buffer against external shocks. Increased consumption, supported by rising incomes and a young demographic, continues to be a primary engine for economic activity.
*   **Government Policy and Reforms:** Initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, infrastructure development projects like the National Infrastructure Pipeline, and continued efforts to improve the ease of doing business have attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) and spurred manufacturing growth. Digital public infrastructure, including UPI, was also frequently cited as a facilitator of economic activity and financial inclusion.
*   **Financial Sector Stability:** India's banking sector has shown improved asset quality and capital adequacy, contributing to overall financial stability. Regulatory reforms have also strengthened the resilience of the financial system.

Industry leaders present at the WEF annual meeting underscored India’s commitment to sustainable development goals and its pivotal role in global supply chain diversification. Discussions revolved around leveraging technology for inclusive growth, transitioning to cleaner energy sources, and enhancing international trade partnerships. The CII further noted that the positive outlook on India was widely acknowledged in various bilateral and multilateral meetings held on the sidelines of the forum.

Looking ahead, the CII indicated that India's engagement with global partners would continue to focus on fostering sustainable economic ties and attracting further investment. The confidence expressed at Davos aims to solidify India's position as a reliable and dynamic economy capable of weathering global volatility and offering significant opportunities for international collaboration in the evolving global economic order.
