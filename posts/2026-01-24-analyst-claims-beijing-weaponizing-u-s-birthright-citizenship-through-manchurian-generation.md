An independent geopolitical analyst has put forth claims suggesting that Beijing is actively employing a strategy to "weaponize" American citizenship, encouraging its nationals to travel to the United States to secure U.S. birth certificates for their children before returning to China. The analyst, Gordon G. Chang, labels these children the "Manchurian Generation," raising concerns about potential long-term strategic implications for the U.S. These claims were reported by The Times of India on October 22, 2022.

Chang's assertions describe a practice where Chinese citizens, often pregnant women, travel to the U.S. specifically to give birth on American soil. This practice leverages the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born within the country's jurisdiction. Once their children obtain U.S. citizenship, the families reportedly return to China, where these children are then raised.

The core of Chang's argument centers on the concept of these individuals growing up with dual allegiances. While holding U.S. citizenship, their upbringing in China under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could, according to Chang, foster loyalty to Beijing. He suggests that in the future, as these individuals mature, they could be leveraged by the Chinese government for various strategic purposes, including intelligence gathering, economic influence, or even political infiltration within the United States.

Key aspects of the claim include:

*   **Birth Tourism:** Chinese nationals travel to the U.S., often utilizing "birth tourism" services, to ensure their children are born on American territory.
*   **14th Amendment:** The children automatically acquire U.S. citizenship due to the birthright citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
*   **"Manchurian Generation":** Chang's term for these children, implying they are U.S. citizens by birth but potentially influenced or controlled by China, akin to a sleeper agent concept.
*   **Strategic Advantage:** The alleged ultimate goal for Beijing is to cultivate a demographic of U.S. citizens who may prioritize Chinese interests, potentially providing long-term strategic advantages in a range of sectors.

Chang has previously articulated concerns about China's perceived long-term strategies regarding other nations. The "Manchurian Generation" concept extends these concerns to the demographic and political landscape of the United States. While the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) considers traveling to the U.S. solely to give birth to be legal, provided the parents are truthful about their intentions, the alleged strategic intent by a foreign government for such practices is what forms the basis of Chang's critique.

The reported claims contribute to an ongoing discussion among geopolitical observers and policymakers regarding the implications of birthright citizenship and the potential for foreign state actors to exploit legal frameworks for strategic gain. As of this report, there has been no official acknowledgment or direct response from the U.S. government regarding the specific claim of China "weaponizing" American citizenship through this particular method.
