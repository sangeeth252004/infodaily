To access their admit cards, candidates are required to log in to the dedicated portal using their unique registration ID and password, or their date of birth, as specified. The direct link for the download has been activated on the official website. It is strongly advised that candidates download and print their admit cards promptly to avoid potential last-minute technical difficulties or network congestion closer to the examination date.

The MTS (General) Examination 2026 is structured as a Computer Based Test (CBT), typically comprising multiple-choice questions. While the precise syllabus and exam pattern for the 2026 cycle are detailed in the official recruitment notification, such examinations generally assess candidates on General Awareness, Quantitative Aptitude, Reasoning Ability, and English Comprehension. The total duration for the examination is commonly 90 minutes, with specific marking schemes for both correct and incorrect answers. Candidates are advised to thoroughly review the official notification for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the 2026 examination structure.

**Key Exam Day Guidelines:**

Candidates appearing for the IB MTS 2026 examination must strictly adhere to a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure a fair and orderly testing environment. These crucial instructions include:

*   **Admit Card Printout:** A clear, legible printout of the admit card is compulsory for entry into the examination hall. Digital copies are not accepted.
*   **Valid Photo Identification:** Candidates must carry an original, valid government-issued photo identification proof. Acceptable IDs typically include an Aadhar Card, PAN Card, Passport, Driving License, or Voter ID. The name on the identification must precisely match the name on the admit card.
*   **Passport-sized Photographs:** Two recent passport-sized photographs, ideally identical to the one uploaded during the online application process, should be brought to the examination center.
*   **Reporting Time:** Aspirants are required to report to their assigned examination center at least 60-90 minutes prior to the official start time of the examination. Latecomers may be denied entry.

*   **Biometric Verification:** Biometric attendance and photograph capture are mandatory procedures conducted at the examination center for candidate verification.
*   **No Re-entry:** Once a candidate leaves the examination hall for any reason after the test commences, re-entry is generally not permitted until the examination officially concludes.

Candidates are strongly advised to meticulously read all instructions printed on their admit card and those published on the official MHA website.
