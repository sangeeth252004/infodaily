Real estate advisory firm PropTiger has projected a 12% decrease in home sales across India by 2025, following a period of robust market growth. The forecast, detailed in a recent company report, attributes the anticipated cooling to macroeconomic factors such as rising interest rates and persistent inflation. Despite the projected downturn in transaction volumes, the report indicates that housing prices are expected to remain resilient, primarily driven by increasing input costs for developers.

This projection follows a period of strong performance in the Indian housing sector. PropTiger's data for the first quarter of 2022 showed a notable increase, with the eight major Indian cities collectively experiencing a 7% year-on-year rise in home sales. The same period also saw average property prices increase by 5-9% across these key markets, reflecting a robust demand environment before the current economic shifts.

The report highlights that a series of interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), implemented to curb inflation, are expected to significantly impact buyer affordability and sentiment. Higher borrowing costs typically lead to reduced purchasing power for prospective homebuyers, directly influencing sales volumes. Coupled with persistent inflationary pressures, these economic adjustments are anticipated to moderate overall demand in the residential sector over the next few years.

*   **Key Factors for Sales Decline:**
    *   **Rising Interest Rates:** Increased home loan costs reduce buyer affordability.
    *   **Inflationary Pressures:** Higher cost of living impacts disposable income for housing investments.
    *   **Moderated Demand:** Collective impact of economic factors expected to slow purchasing activity.

Despite the anticipated slowdown in sales, PropTiger emphasizes that housing prices are not expected to decline significantly. This resilience is primarily attributed to the sustained increase in construction input costs. Materials such as steel, cement, and other raw components, alongside labor wages, have seen continuous upward trends. Developers are likely to pass these higher expenses onto consumers, thereby maintaining or slightly increasing property values rather than absorbing losses.

*   **Factors Supporting Price Resilience:**
    *   **Increased Input Costs:** Higher prices for construction materials and labor.
    *   **Developer Margins:** Developers likely to transfer increased costs to buyers.
    *   **Underlying Demand:** While moderated, a baseline demand for housing persists in key urban centers.

PropTiger’s analysis encompasses India's eight major residential markets: Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), and Pune. While the entire market may experience a generalized slowdown, certain segments, particularly affordable and mid-income housing, could be more susceptible to interest rate sensitivity due to their buyers' dependence on financing.

For potential homebuyers, the report suggests a period of more balanced market activity, potentially offering more negotiation room without the expectation of significant price reductions. Developers, meanwhile, may need to adjust their sales strategies to navigate the environment of higher input costs and moderated demand. PropTiger's assessment underscores the ongoing interplay between macroeconomic factors and the real estate sector, indicating that future market dynamics will largely depend on the trajectory of inflation, further monetary policy decisions by the RBI, and overall economic growth.
