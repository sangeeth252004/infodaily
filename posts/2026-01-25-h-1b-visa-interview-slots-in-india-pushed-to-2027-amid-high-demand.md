Indian professionals seeking H-1B non-immigrant work visas for the United States are encountering substantial delays in securing interview appointments, with the earliest available slots now extending into 2027, according to observations from applicants using the official scheduling system. Across U.S. diplomatic missions in India, the online portal indicates a widespread unavailability of immediate or near-term interview dates, creating uncertainty for thousands of applicants and U.S. employers.

The H-1B visa program is crucial for U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, particularly in technology and other high-skilled fields. This extensive waiting period significantly impacts the career trajectories of Indian professionals, many of whom have received job offers or are poised for U.S. assignments. U.S. businesses reliant on these visas to fill critical skill gaps also face operational challenges due to the inability of their prospective employees to obtain timely appointments. The observed delay primarily affects applicants requiring an in-person interview, typically first-time applicants or those not qualifying for interview waivers.

The situation is evident across the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi and its consulates in Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Applicants attempting to book appointments are consistently being shown dates more than four years in the future, marking a significant increase in wait times compared to pre-pandemic periods. While certain categories, such as renewals or those eligible for drop-box services, might experience different processing times, the core challenge remains for those necessitating a direct interview with a consular officer. The U.S. Department of State processes millions of non-immigrant visas globally each year, with India consistently being one of the largest source countries for H-1B visas.

The extended wait times are a direct observation by individuals navigating the official visa scheduling portal. This delay pertains specifically to the scheduling of the mandatory in-person interview, which is a prerequisite for many H-1B visa issuances. The U.S. government annually allocates 85,000 new H-1B visas, including 20,000 for those with a U.S. master's degree, via a lottery system, underscoring the high demand for this visa category. The current availability for these critical interviews highlights the significant backlog.

As the demand for H-1B visas from India remains consistently high, the protracted wait times for interview appointments present an ongoing challenge for both applicants and the sponsoring U.S. companies. The situation underscores the pressure on consular services in India to manage a large volume of visa applications, a challenge that has been exacerbated by operational adjustments and backlogs accumulated over recent years. While the U.S. government has expressed intentions to streamline visa processing, the current outlook indicates that applicants will need to plan with significantly extended timelines for the foreseeable future.
