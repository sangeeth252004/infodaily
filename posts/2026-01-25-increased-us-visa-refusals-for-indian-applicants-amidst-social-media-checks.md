Indian citizens applying for various United States visa categories are reportedly experiencing an increase in refusal rates, particularly for B1/B2 (business/tourism) and H1B (specialty occupation) visas. This trend is being observed across US Consulates in India and is attributed, in part, to intensified scrutiny of applicants' social media activity, a policy measure formalized by the US Department of State in 2019. The heightened examination of online presence marks a significant shift in the visa application process for many Indian professionals, students, and tourists.

The US Department of State implemented a policy in May 2019 requiring nearly all visa applicants worldwide to submit their social media identifiers, including usernames from various platforms, for the past five years. This measure was introduced as part of broader security enhancements, designed to verify applicant information and identify potential security risks or misrepresentations. Consular officers now routinely review publicly available information on social media platforms as part of the extensive background check process.

This policy has reportedly led to a more stringent evaluation of applicants from India. Visa denials are occurring when discrepancies are found between information provided in the visa application and an individual's social media posts. Such inconsistencies can be interpreted by consular officers as misrepresentation, an undisclosed intent to immigrate, or a potential violation of visa terms. For instance, an H1B visa applicant on an extension might face denial if their past social media activity, perhaps from years ago, suggests an intent to settle in the US permanently or pursue employment outside authorized channels while on a student visa. Similarly, B1/B2 applicants may encounter issues if their online footprint suggests an intention to overstay or seek unauthorized employment.

Immigration legal experts in India have advised applicants to exercise caution regarding their digital footprints. They emphasize that all information shared online, even seemingly innocuous posts, can be accessed and reviewed during the visa adjudication process. Applicants are urged to ensure complete transparency and consistency between their visa application details and their publicly visible social media content to avoid potential grounds for refusal.

The increasing rate of refusals impacts a wide range of Indian individuals, including highly skilled professionals seeking employment in the US, students pursuing higher education, and individuals planning business trips or tourism. This situation carries potential implications for both individuals' career trajectories and the broader bilateral relationship between India and the United States, affecting exchanges in technology, education, and tourism.

As the US Department of State's policy requiring social media disclosure remains in effect, prospective visa applicants are advised to thoroughly review their online presence. Ensuring accuracy and alignment between visa application details and all publicly accessible online information is paramount to navigating the enhanced scrutiny during the visa application process.
