The selection procedure for the MP Police Constable positions is rigorous, comprising several phases designed to evaluate both academic aptitude and physical capabilities.

The MPESB, previously known as the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) or Vyapam, holds the responsibility for conducting various entrance examinations and recruitment tests for government sector positions in the state. The board's role in transparently administering these exams is vital for maintaining public trust and ensuring fair selection processes.
