The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) today unveiled its 15-member squad for the upcoming ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026, marking the highly anticipated return of key players Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi. Babar Azam has been reinstated as the captain, leading the national side for the prestigious tournament co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. The announcement signals the board's strategy for the global event, focusing on a blend of experience and emerging talent.

The squad selection follows a comprehensive review of player performances in recent domestic and international fixtures, aiming to build a formidable unit capable of competing at the highest level. Babar Azam's return to captaincy comes after a period where he had stepped down from the role across all formats in late 2023. His leadership experience, having led Pakistan to the semi-finals of the 2021 T20 World Cup and the final in 2022, is considered a vital asset for the team's ambitions. Shaheen Shah Afridi, a prominent left-arm fast bowler, also re-joins the squad, bringing his match-winning capabilities and pace attack to the forefront.

The T20 World Cup 2026 will see 20 teams compete for the championship, with matches scheduled across venues in India and Sri Lanka during February and March 2026. Pakistan, having been a consistent performer in recent T20 World Cups, will be looking to capitalize on the experience of its returning stars and the dynamism of its younger players. The selection committee has reportedly prioritized versatility and adaptability to different playing conditions expected in the subcontinent.

Key inclusions and roles in the announced squad are:

*   **Babar Azam (Captain):** Top-order batsman, reinstated leader.
*   **Shaheen Shah Afridi (Vice-Captain):** Premier left-arm fast bowler.
*   **Mohammad Rizwan:** Wicketkeeper-batsman, a consistent performer.
*   **Shadab Khan:** All-rounder, leg-spin bowler.
*   **Fakhar Zaman:** Aggressive opening batsman.
*   **Haris Rauf:** Right-arm fast bowler, known for pace.
*   **Naseem Shah:** Young fast bowler, effective with the new ball.

Further details on the squad composition indicate a focus on players with strong T20 records, both domestically and internationally. The selection also includes several emerging players who have impressed with their recent performances in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) and other national tournaments, providing depth and future potential to the team. The rationale behind the appointments of Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi in leadership roles underscores a move to stabilize the team's core and build synergy well in advance of the tournament.

Following the squad announcement, the team is expected to commence specialized training camps and engage in a series of preparatory T20 international matches. These fixtures will serve as crucial opportunities for the squad to fine-tune strategies, foster team cohesion, and adapt to potential conditions similar to those anticipated in India and Sri Lanka. The PCB has outlined a detailed roadmap for the team's preparations, aiming to ensure players are in peak form for the biennial global event.
