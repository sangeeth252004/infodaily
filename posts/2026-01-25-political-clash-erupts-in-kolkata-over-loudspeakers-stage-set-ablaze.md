Kolkata, West Bengal – Supporters of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) engaged in violent altercations in Kolkata’s Beleghata area on Tuesday, November 21, 2023. The dispute, reportedly triggered by disagreements over the use of loudspeakers during a political gathering, escalated rapidly, culminating in property damage and a temporary stage being set on fire. Law enforcement authorities intervened to disperse the crowds and restore order.

The incident unfolded late Tuesday afternoon near the Beleghata constituency office, a locality in North Kolkata. According to initial police reports, a pre-scheduled public meeting organized by local BJP workers was underway when a group of individuals, identified by police as TMC supporters, raised objections regarding the volume and placement of the loudspeakers. Witnesses indicated that verbal arguments quickly devolved into physical confrontations, involving sticks and stones. Several individuals sustained minor injuries, which were treated by local medical personnel on site.

The situation intensified as the clash continued for approximately 30 minutes. During the melee, a temporary stage erected for the BJP event was vandalized and subsequently set ablaze. Fire tenders were dispatched to the scene and extinguished the fire, preventing further property damage. Police personnel, including a contingent of the Rapid Action Force (RAF), arrived promptly to control the escalating violence.

Following the deployment of additional forces, police managed to separate the opposing groups. Authorities confirmed that five individuals from both sides were detained for questioning in connection with the violence and property destruction. A First Information Report (FIR) has been lodged at the Beleghata Police Station, citing charges of rioting, assault, and arson.

Local political leaders from both parties issued statements condemning the violence while simultaneously attributing blame to the opposing faction. Mr. Subrata Sarkar, a local BJP leader, stated that their peaceful gathering was "provoked and attacked" by TMC cadres. Conversely, Ms. Rina Das, a TMC municipal councilor for the area, alleged that BJP workers initiated the confrontation by using "unauthorized high-volume loudspeakers" that disturbed local residents and refused to comply with requests to lower the sound.

The incident highlights the ongoing political tensions prevalent in West Bengal, particularly between the ruling TMC and the opposition BJP, which frequently manifest in localized confrontations. Police officials have stated that investigations are ongoing, including a review of CCTV footage from the vicinity, to identify all individuals involved in the unlawful activities. Security has been heightened in the Beleghata area to prevent further disturbances, and local authorities are appealing for calm. The arrested individuals are expected to be produced before a local court on Wednesday.
