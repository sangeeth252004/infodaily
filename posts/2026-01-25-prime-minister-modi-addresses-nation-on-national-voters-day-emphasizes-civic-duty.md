His address acknowledged the significant contribution of the Election Commission of India (ECI) in conducting free, fair, and transparent elections across the nation.

The observance of National Voters' Day aims to encourage greater participation of eligible voters in the electoral process. Prime Minister Modi’s message highlighted the power of each vote in shaping the future trajectory of the country and reinforcing democratic principles. He called upon citizens to engage actively in civic life, emphasizing that robust voter turnout is a testament to a vibrant democracy.

The Election Commission of India, established on January 25, 1950, is an autonomous constitutional authority responsible for administering election processes in India. This includes overseeing elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, and the offices of the President and Vice President. Throughout its history, the ECI has played a crucial role in upholding the integrity of the electoral system, implementing various initiatives for voter education, registration, and accessibility.

Prime Minister Modi's reference to "Voter a Bhagya Vidhata" serves as a reminder of the sovereign power vested in the electorate. It underscores the belief that collective individual choices at the ballot box directly influence governance, policy-making, and national development. This message is consistently articulated by leaders and civic bodies to motivate citizens to exercise their franchise responsibly and contribute to the democratic process.

Moving forward, the Election Commission of India continues its efforts to modernize election management, enhance voter convenience, and ensure electoral integrity. Campaigns for voter awareness, such as SVEEP (Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation) programs, are regularly conducted to reach diverse demographics. These initiatives aim to foster a more inclusive and participative democracy, echoing the core message of National Voters’ Day and the Prime Minister’s emphasis on the voter’s role as a destiny-maker.
