Mark Tully, the veteran British journalist renowned for his extensive reporting on India for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), has died at the age of 90 in New Delhi. The announcement of his passing marks the end of an era for a correspondent who became synonymous with objective and insightful coverage of the Indian subcontinent for over three decades. Tully, who was born in Kolkata to British parents, made India his home and reported on many of the nation's most significant historical moments.

Tully's career with the BBC spanned more than 30 years, beginning in 1965. He rose to prominence as the BBC's Delhi Bureau Chief in 1972, a position he held until 1994. During his tenure, he provided a consistent and nuanced voice for international audiences seeking to understand India's complex social, political, and cultural landscape. His distinctive reporting style, characterized by a deep familiarity with the region and its people, earned him widespread respect across both India and the United Kingdom.

Born William Mark Tully in Kolkata (then Calcutta) in 1935, he spent his early years in India before moving to England for education. He returned to India with the BBC, cementing a lifelong connection with the country of his birth. Even after leaving the BBC in 1994, Tully chose to remain in India, continuing to write and broadcast as a freelance journalist and commentator. His dedication to understanding and presenting India's narrative went beyond mere professional duty, reflecting a profound personal affinity.

Throughout his distinguished career, Tully reported on a wide array of pivotal events that shaped modern India. His dispatches provided critical international perspectives on:

*   The Emergency (1975-1977), reporting on the period of civil liberties suspension.
*   The Bhopal gas tragedy in 1984, one of the world's worst industrial disasters.
*   The assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 and its aftermath.
*   The Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya in 1992, and the ensuing communal tensions.

For his contributions to journalism and his unique role in fostering cross-cultural understanding, Mark Tully received several prestigious accolades. He was awarded the Padma Shree by the Government of India in 1992, followed by the Padma Bhushan in 2005, two of India's highest civilian honours. In the United Kingdom, he was knighted in 2002, becoming a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). He also authored several books, including "Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi's Last Battle" and "No Full Stops in India," which further explored the country's multifaceted identity.

Mark Tully's legacy is defined by his commitment to factual reporting and his ability to translate the intricacies of Indian society for a global audience. His passing marks the loss of a journalist who not only witnessed but also chronicled, with rare insight and empathy, India's journey through significant historical periods. He leaves behind a body of work that continues to serve as an important reference for understanding India's contemporary history.
