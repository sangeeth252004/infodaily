Sir Mark Tully, the veteran British journalist and author celebrated for his distinctive voice and extensive coverage of India for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), passed away at the age of 90 on September 19, 2022. He died peacefully at his residence in New Delhi, concluding a career that spanned more than three decades and left a significant impact on global understanding of the Indian subcontinent.

Tully's association with India began with his birth in Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935, during the British Raj. After receiving his education in England, he returned to India in 1965 to join the BBC, marking the beginning of a distinguished career. He served as the BBC's India correspondent and eventually as its Bureau Chief in Delhi for over 20 years, a period during which he became one of the most recognizable foreign journalists reporting from the country. His fluency in Hindi and his deep empathy for the Indian people distinguished his reporting from many Western counterparts.

Throughout his tenure, Tully reported on a series of pivotal events that shaped modern India. His on-the-ground coverage provided critical insights into:
*   The Indo-Pakistan Wars
*   The Emergency period (1975-1977)
*   Operation Blue Star and the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984
*   The Bhopal Gas Tragedy in 1984
*   The demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in 1992

Upon his retirement from the BBC in 1994, Tully chose to remain in India, continuing to write and comment on Indian affairs. His post-BBC career saw him publish several acclaimed books that offered nuanced perspectives on the country's social, political, and cultural landscape. Notable works include:
*   *Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi's Last Battle* (1985), co-authored with Satish Jacob
*   *No Full Stops in India* (1991)
*   *The Heart of India* (1995)
*   *India in Slow Motion* (2002), co-authored with Gillian Wright

His contributions to journalism and his efforts in fostering understanding between Britain and India were widely recognized. The Government of India honored him with the Padma Shree in 1992 and the Padma Bhushan in 2005, two of the country's highest civilian awards. In the United Kingdom, he was knighted in 2002, becoming Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), for his services to broadcasting.

Tully's legacy is defined by his commitment to factual reporting, his ability to convey complex narratives with clarity, and his unique role in interpreting India for a global audience. His passing drew condolences from political leaders, fellow journalists, and the public, reflecting the widespread respect he commanded for his profound connection to India and his integrity in reporting its story.
