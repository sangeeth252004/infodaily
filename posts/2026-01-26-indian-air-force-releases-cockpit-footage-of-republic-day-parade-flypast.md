New Delhi – The Indian Air Force (IAF) released a series of videos offering an unprecedented cockpit-level view of its Republic Day Parade flypast, which took place on January 26, 2022. These unique aerial perspectives provided the public with an intimate glimpse into the precision and coordination required for one of the parade's most anticipated segments, observed annually over Kartavya Path (formerly Rajpath) in New Delhi.

The videos, shared through official IAF channels, captured various formations and individual aircraft maneuvers from the pilots' vantage point. This marked a significant departure from traditional ground-level or distant media coverage, allowing viewers to experience the intricate sequences as if they were present in the cockpit. The footage highlighted the strategic positioning and synchronized movements of multiple aircraft, often flying in close proximity, demonstrating the high level of training and discipline within the IAF.

The Republic Day Parade flypast is a key feature of India's national celebration, commemorating the date the Constitution of India came into effect. The 2022 flypast was particularly notable, featuring a grand formation of 75 aircraft to mark 75 years of India's independence, an 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' celebration. Aircraft types participating in the display commonly include a diverse range, from fighter jets like the Rafale and Sukhoi Su-30MKI to transport aircraft such as the C-130J Super Hercules and C-17 Globemaster III, alongside helicopters like the Apache and Mi-17V5. The released videos showcased segments from these diverse formations, offering distinct perspectives on their operational execution.
