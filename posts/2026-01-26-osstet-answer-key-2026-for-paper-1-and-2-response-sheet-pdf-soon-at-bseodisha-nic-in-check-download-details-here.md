The Board of Secondary Education (BSE) Odisha is slated to release the provisional answer key for the Odisha Secondary School Teacher Eligibility Test (OSSTET) 2026 for both Paper 1 and Paper 2. Candidates who appeared for the examination will soon be able to access their respective response sheets and the official answer key in PDF format on the board's designated website, bseodisha.nic.in. This release aims to provide transparency and allow candidates to assess their performance prior to the final result declaration.

The OSSTET is a crucial eligibility test for aspiring teachers in secondary schools across Odisha. Paper 1 of the examination is typically conducted for prospective Trained Graduate Teachers (TGTs), while Paper 2 is designed for Physical Education Teachers (PETs) and other categories. The impending release of the answer key and response sheets is a significant development for thousands of candidates awaiting official clarification on the correct answers to the questions posed in the 2026 examination. Candidates will require their examination roll number and date of birth or other specified login credentials to access these documents from the online portal.

Following the release of the provisional answer key, BSE Odisha typically initiates a stipulated window during which candidates can review the provided answers and submit objections against any discrepancies they identify. This objection window is a standard part of the examination process, ensuring fairness and accuracy. Candidates wishing to raise an objection are generally required to provide substantial evidence or justification to support their claim. Specific instructions regarding the objection submission process, including any associated fees and the deadline, will be published alongside the answer key.

The board will then review all submitted objections. Based on this review, a final answer key will be prepared, incorporating any necessary changes. This final answer key serves as the definitive reference for the evaluation of OMR sheets and the compilation of candidates' scores.

To download the OSSTET 2026 Answer Key and response sheet, candidates should follow these steps:
*   Navigate to the official website of BSE Odisha: bseodisha.nic.in.
*   Locate the direct link for "OSSTET 2026 Answer Key" or "Response Sheet."
*   Click on the link corresponding to Paper 1 or Paper 2, as applicable.
*   Enter the required login credentials, such as roll number and date of birth, into the designated fields.
*   The answer key and response sheet will be displayed on the screen.
*   Download the PDF document and consider printing it for future reference and for calculating probable scores.

Upon the conclusion of the objection period and the finalization of the answer key, BSE Odisha will proceed with the declaration of the OSSTET 2026 results. The outcome of this examination will determine candidates' eligibility for various teaching positions in government and private secondary schools throughout the state, as per the recruitment norms set by the Odisha government. Candidates are advised to regularly monitor the official website for all subsequent announcements and updates regarding the examination process.
