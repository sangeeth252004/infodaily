New Delhi – India’s rapidly expanding private space sector has formally communicated its key expectations for the upcoming Union Budget 2026, with a strong focus on enhancing government procurement and securing critical infrastructure status for the industry. These proposals aim to accelerate growth, attract further investment, and solidify India's position in the global space economy.

Representatives from various private space firms, through industry associations and direct communications, have highlighted the necessity of government support to scale operations and innovate. A central demand involves the government mandating a specific percentage of its space-related procurements from domestic private entities. This measure is intended to provide a stable demand base, crucial for companies engaged in satellite manufacturing, launch services, ground systems, and space-based applications. Currently, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) remains the primary national customer for space technologies, and private firms seek to diversify this demand across various government departments and public sector undertakings. Proponents argue that such a policy would align with the 'Make in India' initiative, fostering indigenous capabilities and reducing reliance on foreign imports for critical space components and services.

Another significant request from the private space industry is the declaration of critical infrastructure status for the sector. Granting this status would afford the space industry several benefits, including priority access to institutional credit, potential tax incentives, and streamlined regulatory processes. Similar statuses are enjoyed by sectors such as telecommunications, power, and logistics, recognizing their foundational role in national development and security. Companies contend that this designation would not only ease financial burdens but also signal long-term government commitment, thereby making the sector more attractive to both domestic and international investors. It would also facilitate faster project execution and resource allocation, deemed essential for an industry characterized by high capital expenditure and extended development cycles.

The demands come amidst a period of significant policy reform, notably the India Space Policy 2023, which aims to open up the sector to greater private participation. The policy envisions a scenario where private entities play a more substantial role in national space activities, including satellite development, launch services, and data utilization. Industry stakeholders project that with appropriate governmental backing, India can significantly increase its share in the multi-billion dollar global space market, which is currently estimated to be a small fraction. This expansion is expected to generate high-skill employment, foster technological innovation, and create new economic opportunities across various ancillary industries.

Key demands outlined by the private space sector include:

*   Mandatory government procurement targets for private Indian space companies.
*   Official recognition of the space sector as critical infrastructure.
*   Introduction of tax incentives for research and development activities within the space domain.
*   Facilitated access to low-cost financing and credit lines for space startups and enterprises.

The Ministry of Finance, along with other relevant ministries, is expected to review these recommendations as part of its pre-budget consultation process. The final provisions and allocations for the space sector will be articulated during the announcement of the Union Budget 2026, a document that will significantly influence the trajectory and growth potential of India's burgeoning private space industry. The industry awaits the budget's outcomes, which are anticipated to shape its operational landscape for the coming fiscal year and beyond.
