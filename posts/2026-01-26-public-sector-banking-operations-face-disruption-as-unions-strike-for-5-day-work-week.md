Public sector banking services across India were significantly impacted on Tuesday, as various unions initiated a nationwide strike demanding a five-day work week. The industrial action, called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), a conglomerate of nine major banking unions, aimed to pressure management and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) into accepting their long-standing demand for revised working hours.

The strike action, affecting 12 public sector banks, was expected to disrupt routine banking transactions for millions of customers. Services such as cash withdrawals and deposits, cheque clearing, loan processing, and remittance facilities were anticipated to be severely hampered throughout the day. While private sector banks typically remained operational, their customers could still experience indirect effects due to disruptions in interbank transactions and clearinghouse operations.

The primary demand driving the strike is the implementation of a five-day work week, allowing for Saturday and Sunday to be non-working days. Currently, public sector banks operate on the first, third, and fifth Saturdays of the month. Unions argue that this move would align the banking sector with practices in other industries and improve employee work-life balance. Negotiations on this matter have been ongoing for several years, with unions highlighting it as a crucial component of their broader demands for improved service conditions.

Key details surrounding the strike include:

*   **Participants:** The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), which represents a significant majority of public sector bank employees across the nation.
*   **Core Demand:** A shift to a five-day work week, making all Saturdays non-working days for public sector bank employees.
*   **Affected Services:**
    *   Cash deposits and withdrawals at branches.
    *   Cheque clearing processes.
    *   Interbank transfers and remittances.
    *   Loan applications and disbursements.
    *   Government treasury operations handled by public sector banks.
*   **Geographic Scope:** The strike was observed across various states and union territories, impacting public sector bank branches nationwide.
*   **Exclusions:** Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and digital banking platforms, such as mobile banking and internet banking, largely remained operational, offering some relief for urgent transactions. However, these services often rely on branch backend support for cash replenishment and technical assistance, which could be indirectly affected.

The disruption underscores the ongoing tension between bank management, the government, and employee unions over working conditions and benefits. Previous strike actions have periodically occurred, each time drawing attention to the unions' demands for better pay, pension updates, and service agreements. The financial sector, a backbone of the Indian economy, often faces scrutiny during such disruptions due to the direct impact on trade, commerce, and individual financial planning.

Following the strike, attention is expected to turn to further discussions between the UFBU, the IBA, and the government. While immediate resolution of the five-day work week demand was not certain, the strike served as a clear signal of the unions' resolve. Customers were advised to utilize digital banking channels or plan their transactions in advance for any upcoming bank holidays or potential future disruptions. The long-term resolution of these demands will likely involve continued negotiations and could shape the future operational structure of India's public sector banking landscape.
