Mumbai, India – PVR INOX Ltd., India's largest multiplex chain, has announced the divestment of its gourmet popcorn and snacks brand, 4700BC, to fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant Marico Ltd. The transaction, valued at Rs 226.8 crore, marks a strategic move by PVR INOX to sharpen its focus on its core cinema exhibition business and optimize capital allocation.

The agreement, confirmed by both companies, sees Marico acquiring a significant stake in the brand, integrating 4700BC into its expanding portfolio of food products. For PVR INOX, the sale represents a streamlining of operations following the merger of PVR and INOX Leisure in 2023, allowing the company to concentrate resources on enhancing the cinematic experience and operational efficiencies across its vast network of theatres.

4700BC, founded in 2013, has established itself as a prominent brand in the gourmet popcorn and snacks segment. Initially conceived as an in-cinema F&B offering, it expanded its presence to retail stores, e-commerce platforms, and other institutional channels. The brand's diverse product range includes popcorn, corn-based snacks, and other convenience foods, catering to a growing consumer demand for premium snacking options. PVR INOX’s decision to exit the non-core venture underscores its commitment to navigating the evolving entertainment landscape, which has seen shifts in audience consumption patterns and increased competition from digital platforms.

For Marico Ltd., known for household brands like Saffola, Parachute, and Livon, the acquisition of 4700BC aligns with its strategy to expand its footprint in the rapidly growing healthy foods and snacking categories. The company has been actively diversifying its portfolio beyond traditional personal care products, with a notable push into new-age food offerings. The addition of 4700BC is expected to leverage Marico's extensive distribution network, marketing capabilities, and consumer insights to scale the brand further and strengthen its position in the competitive FMCG market.

Key details of the transaction include:
*   **Seller:** PVR INOX Ltd.
*   **Buyer:** Marico Ltd.
*   **Asset Sold:** 4700BC gourmet popcorn and snacks brand.
*   **Transaction Value:** Rs 226.8 crore.
*   **PVR INOX Rationale:** To focus on core cinema business, enhance operational efficiency post-merger.
*   **Marico Rationale:** Expansion into new-age food and snacking categories, portfolio diversification.

This strategic divestment by PVR INOX is expected to provide financial flexibility and allow management to dedicate undivided attention to content acquisition, audience engagement, and theatre infrastructure development. The company aims to fortify its leadership position in the Indian cinema market by optimizing its core offerings. Marico, on the other hand, is poised to integrate 4700BC into its existing food ecosystem, potentially introducing new products and expanding the brand's reach across various consumer touchpoints, both online and offline. The move highlights broader trends of corporate entities refining their strategic focus and FMCG companies aggressively pursuing growth in emerging food segments.
