New Delhi witnessed a political dispute following the 74th Republic Day parade on January 26, 2023, as the Indian National Congress (INC) questioned the seating arrangements for its top leaders. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and former party president Rahul Gandhi were seated in the third row at the Kartavya Path event, a placement the INC described as a breach of protocol and a sign of disrespect, sparking a sharp retort from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The INC contended that the seating of its senior leaders, particularly the then Leader of Opposition (LoP) Mallikarjun Kharge, did not align with established government protocol for such a significant national event. Party spokespersons highlighted that previous Leaders of Opposition and senior opposition figures had historically been accorded front-row or second-row seating. Congress leaders publicly stated their dissatisfaction, suggesting the arrangement was politically motivated and deviated from customary practice. They specifically pointed out that former Congress President Sonia Gandhi had previously been seated in the first row at similar events.

In response, the BJP and government officials defended the seating plan, asserting that it strictly adhered to extant protocol based on the constitutional positions of the attendees. BJP representatives clarified that the seating matrix for Republic Day parades is determined by a hierarchy that places constitutional functionaries, such as the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, and Chief Justice of India, in the front rows, followed by cabinet ministers, state chief ministers, and then the Leader of Opposition. According to government sources, the LoP is typically placed in the third row, a protocol that was reportedly followed in this instance for Mr. Kharge. Rahul Gandhi, as a Member of Parliament, was seated according to the protocol for elected legislators.

The exchange underscores persistent political tensions between India’s primary national parties. The Congress party's allegations suggested a deliberate attempt by the government to diminish the stature of the opposition at a national event, while the BJP maintained that the government simply followed long-standing conventions. This disagreement over protocol highlights the differing interpretations of established norms and the broader political landscape surrounding major national celebrations. The incident became a talking point in political circles, drawing comparisons to past Republic Day ceremonies and reigniting debates about parliamentary decorum and respect for the opposition.

*   **Key Figures Involved:** Mallikarjun Kharge (then Congress President and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha), Rahul Gandhi (Member of Parliament and former Congress President).
*   **Event:** India's 74th Republic Day parade, held on January 26, 2023, at Kartavya Path, New Delhi.
*   **Congress's Stance:** Allege protocol violation, disrespect, political vendetta. Cited past instances of LoPs receiving more prominent seating.
*   **BJP's Stance:** Asserted adherence to strict government protocol based on constitutional positions, placing LoP in the third row.

While the parade itself proceeded without incident, the post-event commentary from both sides continued to fuel political discussion. The debate over seating arrangements concluded with neither side conceding, leaving the differing interpretations of protocol as a point of ongoing contention within the nation's political discourse. The event served as a reminder of the scrutiny applied to even ceremonial aspects of national events when political rivalries are acute.
