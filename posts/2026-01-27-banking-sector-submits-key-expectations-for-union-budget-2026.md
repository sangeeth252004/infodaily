New Delhi, India – India's banking and financial services sector has formally submitted its recommendations and expectations to the Ministry of Finance in anticipation of the Union Budget 2026. These proposals, presented by various industry associations and financial institutions, primarily focus on driving economic growth, enhancing financial inclusion, and stabilizing the financial ecosystem through targeted policy adjustments in pension, insurance, and taxation.

The submitted recommendations underscore the sector's desire for legislative and fiscal measures that can stimulate savings, boost domestic and foreign investment, and foster a more robust financial landscape. Stakeholders emphasize the importance of policy consistency and forward-looking reforms to sustain the current growth trajectory and address emerging economic challenges. The Ministry of Finance is currently reviewing these inputs as part of its extensive pre-budget consultation process, which aims to integrate diverse perspectives into the national financial plan.

Key areas of focus within the submissions include:

*   **Pension System Reforms:** The sector has called for measures to encourage greater participation in long-term retirement savings schemes. Proposed changes often include:
    *   Increasing the existing tax deduction limits under Section 80C or introducing a dedicated higher deduction for pension contributions, aiming to incentivize individuals to save more for retirement.
    *   Simplifying the withdrawal norms for certain pension products to enhance their appeal and flexibility.
    *   Expanding the scope of eligible investments for pension funds to generate better returns and align with national infrastructure goals.
    *   Recommendations also advocate for greater awareness campaigns to promote pension planning, particularly among the unorganized sector workforce.

*   **Insurance Sector Adjustments:** The insurance industry has put forth proposals aimed at deepening insurance penetration across the country and making products more accessible and affordable. These include:
    *   Rationalization of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on various insurance premiums, particularly for health and life insurance policies, which could reduce the cost for policyholders.
    *   Providing specific tax incentives for purchasing long-term health and critical illness policies to enhance social security coverage.
    *   Streamlining regulatory processes to facilitate product innovation and faster market entry for new offerings, catering to diverse customer needs.
    *   Exploring measures to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) limits in the insurance sector further, subject to market conditions, to attract capital and expertise.

*   **Tax Relief and Incentives:** Broad-based tax measures were also a significant part of the recommendations, targeting both individual taxpayers and corporate entities within the financial sector. Proposals include:
    *   Revisiting individual income tax slabs and potentially increasing the standard deduction to boost disposable income and consumer spending.
    *   Introducing specific tax holiday schemes or reduced corporate tax rates for financial institutions investing in green finance, digital infrastructure, or rural banking initiatives.
    *   Adjustments to capital gains tax provisions for certain financial assets to encourage long-term investments and participation in capital markets.
    *   Incentivizing digital transactions and fintech adoption through tax benefits for customers and service providers.

Beyond these specific reforms, the banking sector has also requested continued government support for recapitalization of public sector banks where necessary, and measures to improve the ease of doing business by simplifying compliance requirements. Emphasis was also placed on fostering a robust regulatory environment that supports technological innovation while ensuring financial stability.

The Ministry of Finance is expected to synthesize these recommendations alongside inputs from other sectors and economic considerations. The final decisions regarding these proposals will be unveiled when Union Finance Minister presents the Union Budget 2026 in the Parliament, typically scheduled for early next year. The financial sector and the public alike await the budget announcement, which is anticipated to set the fiscal and economic direction for the coming year.
