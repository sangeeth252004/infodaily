Financial experts and market participants have collectively urged the Indian government to introduce significant reforms in the upcoming Union Budget 2026, specifically targeting the expansion of retail investor participation in the nation's corporate bond market. A central demand within these recommendations is the establishment of tax parity between bond investments and other asset classes, notably equities, to enhance the attractiveness of debt instruments for individual investors.

These calls for reform highlight the current underrepresentation of retail investors in India's bond market, which primarily sees institutional involvement. Increasing retail engagement is deemed crucial for deepening the market, providing alternative funding avenues for corporations, and offering individual investors diversified portfolio options beyond traditional equity and fixed deposit instruments. A robust retail debt market is also seen as a step towards greater financial inclusion and stability.

The primary hurdle identified by industry bodies and financial analysts is the existing tax structure. Currently, capital gains on listed bonds held for over 12 months are taxed at a flat rate of 10% without indexation, or at income tax slab rates if held for less than 12 months. In contrast, long-term capital gains on listed equities are taxed at 10% without indexation for gains exceeding ₹1 lakh, with short-term gains at 15%. Experts argue that the absence of indexation benefits for bonds, unlike certain other long-term assets, places them at a disadvantage, eroding real returns for investors due to inflation.

Key proposals put forth by market participants include:

*   **Harmonization of Capital Gains Tax:** Realigning the tax treatment for long-term capital gains on bonds with that of equities, potentially introducing indexation benefits for bonds held for an extended period.
*   **Simplification of Investment Processes:** Streamlining the procedural aspects for retail investors to access corporate bonds, building on existing initiatives like the RBI Retail Direct Scheme for government securities.
*   **Increased Awareness:** Promoting educational campaigns to inform retail investors about the benefits and risks associated with corporate bond investing.

Such reforms are expected to complement ongoing efforts by regulatory bodies like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to facilitate direct bond market access for retail investors. The objective is to create a more level playing field that encourages individual investors to allocate a portion of their savings into debt instruments, thereby contributing to broader capital market development.

The recommendations will now be considered by the Ministry of Finance as it formulates the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2026-27. The industry anticipates that the government will address these proposals to foster a more inclusive and vibrant bond market, ultimately benefiting both investors and the corporate sector.
