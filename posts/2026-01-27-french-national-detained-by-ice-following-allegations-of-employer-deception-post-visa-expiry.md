A French national, identified as Thomas B., was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for approximately one month in late 2023. His detention at an ICE facility in New Hampshire followed his arrest in Massachusetts in October 2023. The arrest occurred after his H-1B visa had reportedly expired, with Thomas B. alleging that his employer, Vneuron, continued to pay him, which he claims led him to believe his immigration status remained valid.

Thomas B.'s H-1B visa reportedly expired in January 2023. Despite this, he alleges that Vneuron, a Tunisian technology company with operations in the U.S. under the name Vneuron North America, continued to pay his salary for several months following the expiry. He stated he was under the impression that his employment status was valid or in the process of being renewed, citing ongoing discussions and documentation provided by the company. He expressed, "I thought I was protected," referring to his continued employment and communication with his employer.

The situation underscores the complexities and potential vulnerabilities faced by foreign workers regarding their immigration status in the United States. ICE policy generally dictates that individuals whose visas have expired are subject to arrest and subsequent deportation proceedings. Thomas B.'s legal team is currently working to challenge his detention and navigate the U.S. immigration system.

Key details surrounding the case include:
*   Thomas B., a French national, was arrested by ICE agents outside his Massachusetts apartment in October 2023.
*   He was subsequently detained for approximately one month at an ICE facility in New Hampshire.
*   His H-1B visa status reportedly expired in January 2023.
*   Thomas B. alleges that Vneuron continued his salary payments and provided documentation that he interpreted as maintaining his legal employment status post-visa expiry.
*   The Times of India reported that Vneuron North America has not publicly commented on these allegations.

Thomas B. faces potential deportation proceedings in immigration court. His legal representatives are pursuing options to challenge his continued detention and his immigration status, asserting that he was misled regarding his employment and visa compliance. The outcome of his immigration court hearings will determine his future ability to remain in the United States. This case may draw further attention to the responsibilities of employers in ensuring the legal immigration status of their foreign national employees and the clarity of communication surrounding visa processes.
