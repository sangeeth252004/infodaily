The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSEB) has announced the release of hall tickets for the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Class 12 practical examinations scheduled for the 2026 academic session. Students registered for these crucial assessments can now access and download their admit cards directly from the board’s designated official website. This development marks a significant administrative step for candidates across science, general, and vocational streams who are preparing for their upcoming practical assessments, which form an integral part of their overall Class 12 evaluation.

The availability of these hall tickets is a mandatory prerequisite for students to gain entry to their respective practical examination centers. Each admit card is a vital document, meticulously detailing essential information pertinent to the examination. This includes the student's full name, roll number, the specific examination center assigned, the subjects for which practical tests are to be taken, and the precise dates and timings for these assessments. The release of these hall tickets by the GSEB aims to provide both students and educational institutions with ample time to prepare logistically and academically, minimizing last-minute complications before the practical exam period commences.

Practical examinations hold substantial weight in the final HSC scores, particularly for science subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, as well as vocational courses. They are designed to assess a student's hands-on skills, experimental knowledge, and application of theoretical concepts. Therefore, securing and verifying the correct hall ticket promptly is paramount for all eligible candidates. The board's systematic approach ensures that the examination process runs smoothly, reflecting its commitment to transparent and efficient academic administration for thousands of students across Gujarat.

To download their hall tickets, students are typically required to visit the official GSEB portal, which is designed with secure access protocols. The download process generally involves entering specific login credentials, such as their school index number, registration number, or seat number, often combined with a date of birth or other unique identification details for verification purposes. While individual students can access their admit cards, schools often play a pivotal role, facilitating the bulk download and distribution of these hall tickets to their enrolled students. This ensures that every candidate receives their correct admit card and is fully aware of their examination schedule.
