NEW DELHI – The Indian government has announced a significant policy shift aimed at attracting global electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, introducing a framework that dramatically reduces import tariffs on specific categories of EVs. Under the new Electric Vehicle Policy, import duties for certain vehicles will be phased down from 110% to 10% over a 10-year period, contingent on manufacturers committing to substantial local investment and production within India. The announcement was made on March 15, 2024, marking a pivotal moment for the nation's burgeoning EV sector.

The policy targets high-value electric vehicles, specifically those with a C.I.F. (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) value of $35,000 USD or more. This strategic reduction in tariffs is designed to incentivize major international EV players to establish manufacturing operations in India, thereby boosting local production capabilities, fostering technological advancement, and creating employment opportunities. The existing high import duties, which range from 60% to 100% depending on the vehicle's C.I.F. value, have historically posed a significant barrier to entry for foreign EV brands in the Indian market.

To qualify for the reduced import tariffs, participating manufacturers must adhere to a strict set of conditions:

*   **Minimum Investment:** Companies must commit to a minimum investment of $500 million (approximately ₹4,150 crore) in India. This investment is required to support the establishment of manufacturing facilities and related infrastructure.
*   **Manufacturing Establishment:** A binding commitment to establish manufacturing facilities within India must be made within three years from the date of policy approval. This ensures that the tariff concessions directly translate into domestic production.
*   **Domestic Value Addition (DVA):** Manufacturers are mandated to achieve a 25% domestic value addition within three years and further increase it to 50% within five years. This condition aims to promote localization of the supply chain and reduce reliance on imported components.
*   **Import Quota:** A fixed annual import quota of 250,000 units (2.5 lakh vehicles) will be permitted for eligible manufacturers. This quota allows for a controlled influx of fully built units while local production ramps up. The import duty within this quota will be set at 15% for a period aligned with the investment and DVA targets. The reduction from 110% to 10% specifically refers to a long-term goal for companies committed to full localization over a decade, with an interim lower rate during the establishment phase.

This policy represents a calculated move by the Indian government to integrate into the global EV supply chain and position itself as a key manufacturing hub. Proponents suggest the policy could attract major global automakers, fostering increased competition, accelerating EV adoption, and potentially making advanced EV technology more accessible to Indian consumers in the long run.

The implementation of this policy will be closely monitored as global EV manufacturers evaluate the new framework. Industry analysts anticipate that several prominent international EV brands will consider leveraging these incentives to enter or expand their presence in the Indian market. The coming months are expected to reveal which companies will formally commit to these investment and manufacturing requirements, setting the stage for potential transformations within India's automotive landscape.
