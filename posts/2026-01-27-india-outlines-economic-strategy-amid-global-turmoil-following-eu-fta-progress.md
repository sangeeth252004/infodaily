Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently underscored India's strategic economic approach amidst what he described as "turmoil in the global environment." His remarks followed significant progress on the "historic" Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union, a development he presented as crucial for India's future growth trajectory and global positioning.

Addressing stakeholders, Prime Minister Modi highlighted a volatile international landscape characterized by supply chain disruptions, rising inflation, and geopolitical complexities. He stressed the imperative for nations to cultivate internal resilience and foster robust economic partnerships to navigate these challenges effectively. In this context, he reiterated his "double engine" pitch, a concept often used to signify the synergy and coordinated efforts between central and state governments in India to accelerate development and capitalize on economic opportunities. Within the broader global context, this approach aims to strengthen India's domestic economic foundations, enabling it to better withstand external shocks and leverage international collaborations such as the FTA with the EU.

The India-European Union FTA is being described as a landmark agreement with the potential to significantly boost bilateral trade and investment. The European Union is one of India's largest trading partners, with trade in goods alone amounting to approximately €88 billion in 2021. For the EU, India represents a rapidly expanding market and a key strategic partner. The FTA aims to reduce tariffs, open up market access for goods and services, and establish robust frameworks for investment protection, intellectual property rights, and sustainable development.

Key aspects of the ongoing discussions and anticipated benefits include:
*   **Enhanced Market Access:** Removing trade barriers for a wide range of products, from agricultural goods to manufactured items.
*   **Services Liberalisation:** Facilitating easier access for service providers in sectors such as IT, finance, and professional services.
*   **Investment Flows:** Creating a more predictable and transparent environment for investors, encouraging greater foreign direct investment.
*   **Diversification of Supply Chains:** Offering a strategic alternative for global supply chains, reducing reliance on single regions.
*   **Job Creation:** Increased trade and investment are expected to stimulate economic activity and generate employment opportunities in both India and EU member states.

Prime Minister Modi's statements underscored India's ambition to become a $5 trillion economy, viewing strategic trade agreements like the EU FTA as integral to achieving this objective. The "historic" designation reflects the comprehensive nature of the agreement, which extends beyond traditional trade to encompass broader economic cooperation and policy alignment.

Looking ahead, the successful conclusion and ratification of the India-EU FTA will mark a significant milestone in global trade relations. Both sides are committed to expediting the negotiation process to finalise the agreement, which is expected to shape the economic landscape for years to come. India's strategy appears focused on balancing robust domestic growth drivers with strategic international trade agreements to ensure stability and sustained prosperity amidst an evolving global environment.
