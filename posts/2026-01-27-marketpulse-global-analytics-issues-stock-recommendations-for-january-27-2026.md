*   **Coal India Ltd. (CIL):** Rated as a **'Buy'** with a target price of ₹480.

*   **Fortis Healthcare Ltd.:** Rated as a **'Buy'** with a target price of ₹520.
    *   **Rationale:** Recommendations were based on Fortis Healthcare's expanding network of healthcare facilities, anticipated increases in patient footfall, and a general upswing in the healthcare services sector.
*   **Tata Motors Ltd.:** Rated as a **'Hold'** with a target price of ₹950.
    *   **Rationale:** MarketPulse Global Analytics advised a 'hold' position, noting steady performance in the commercial vehicle segment but acknowledging increasing competition and evolving market dynamics in the electric vehicle (EV) sector.
