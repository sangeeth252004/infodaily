Security forces have intensified extensive cordon and search operations (CASO) across parts of Kishtwar district following a fresh gunfight with suspected militants earlier this week. The ongoing efforts are part of "Op Trashi-I," a named operation aimed at tracking down individuals involved in the confrontation and maintaining security in the region. The operation, involving personnel from the Indian Army and the Jammu and Kashmir Police, is focused on dense forested areas and remote hamlets where militant movement was suspected.

The initial exchange of fire occurred on [Insert Day, e.g., Monday] morning when security patrols established contact with a group of suspected militants in a mountainous sector of Kishtwar. While the exact details of the confrontation remain under investigation, preliminary reports indicate an exchange of automatic weapon fire. Following the gunfight, the militants reportedly managed to disengage under the cover of thick foliage and difficult terrain, prompting the launch of the expanded search operation. No casualties among security forces have been officially reported at this stage of the operation.

Kishtwar district, known for its rugged topography and challenging accessibility, has historically been a focus for counter-militancy operations. "Op Trashi-I" signifies a targeted effort by security agencies to neutralize residual militant cells and disrupt their networks operating within the district. The current phase of the operation involves deploying specialized search teams equipped for mountainous terrain, utilizing advanced surveillance techniques, and establishing multiple layers of cordon to restrict the movement of the suspected individuals.

Key aspects of the ongoing operation include:
*   **Area of Focus:** Search parties are meticulously combing through dense forests, natural caves, and abandoned structures across several villages identified as potential transit or hideout zones.
*   **Intelligence Gathering:** Local intelligence networks have been activated, and input from villagers is being continuously assessed to guide the search efforts.
*   **Civilian Safety:** Measures are in place to ensure minimal disruption to civilian life, with local police engaging community leaders to foster cooperation and provide timely information.
*   **Objective:** The primary objective remains the apprehension or neutralization of the militants involved in the recent gunfight and the recovery of any arms, ammunition, or incriminating material.

Officials emphasize that the searches will continue relentlessly until the area is thoroughly sanitized and the threat is neutralized. The renewed focus in Kishtwar underscores the ongoing commitment of security forces to counter militant activities and ensure peace and stability in the region. Authorities have appealed to the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the nearest security establishment. Further updates on "Op Trashi-I" are expected as the operation progresses and additional details emerge from the ground.
