The Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) has officially released the examination city and date slips for the Computer-Based Test (CBT) for Group D posts under Centralised Employment Notice (CEN) 08/2024. Candidates who have applied for this examination can now access their respective slips by visiting the designated official website, rrbapply.gov.in. This release marks a significant procedural step for applicants preparing for the February CBT.

The exam city slip is a preliminary document that informs candidates about their examination city, the specific date of their CBT, and the shift details. It is intended to assist candidates in making necessary travel and accommodation arrangements well in advance of the examination date. The Group D recruitment drive encompasses a substantial number of vacancies across various railway zones, making this a widely anticipated development for numerous aspirants seeking employment within the Indian Railways.

The Computer-Based Test (CBT) is the initial stage of the recruitment process for Group D positions. Successful candidates in the CBT will proceed to subsequent stages, which typically include the Physical Efficiency Test (PET), Document Verification (DV), and Medical Examination, as per the established recruitment guidelines of the Railway Recruitment Board. The accurate and timely dissemination of exam-related information is crucial for maintaining transparency and facilitating smooth examination conduct.

Candidates are advised to take the following steps and note key details:

*   **Accessing the Slip:** Candidates must log in to rrbapply.gov.in using their registration number and date of birth to download their exam city slip.
*   **Information Contained:** The slip will display the candidate's exam date, exam city, and examination shift. It will not include the exact examination centre address, which is typically provided in the e-call letter.
*   **E-Call Letter Distinction:** The exam city slip is distinct from the e-call letter (admit card). The e-call letter, which contains the precise examination centre address and reporting time, is generally released approximately four days prior to the candidate's scheduled examination date.
*   **Mandatory Documents:** On the day of the examination, candidates are required to carry a printed copy of their e-call letter, a valid photo identity proof in original, and a passport-sized photograph. Failure to produce these documents may result in denial of entry to the examination hall.
*   **Verification of Details:** Applicants are urged to carefully verify all details mentioned on their exam city slip and subsequently on their e-call letter to ensure accuracy and report any discrepancies to the concerned RRB immediately.

Following the release of these city slips, candidates are expected to intensify their preparation for the upcoming CBT in February. The Railway Recruitment Board will continue to provide further updates and instructions regarding the examination process and subsequent stages on its official regional websites. Candidates are advised to regularly monitor these platforms for the latest announcements to ensure they remain informed throughout the recruitment cycle.
