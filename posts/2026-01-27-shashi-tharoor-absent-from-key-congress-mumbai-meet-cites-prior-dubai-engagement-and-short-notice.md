Congress Member of Parliament (MP) Shashi Tharoor was absent from a significant party meeting held in Mumbai in mid-October 2022. Mr. Tharoor stated that his non-attendance was due to a pre-scheduled engagement in Dubai and insufficient notice from the party for the meeting. The gathering was a key preparatory session for the Indian National Congress as it strategizes for the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha general elections.

This marks another instance of Mr. Tharoor missing an important party event, following his recent high-profile bid for the Congress presidency. The Mumbai meeting was convened to deliberate on electoral strategies and organizational matters crucial for the party's performance in the next national elections. His non-attendance has drawn attention given his prominent public profile and his recent challenge to the party's leadership status quo in the internal presidential elections.

Key details surrounding Mr. Tharoor's absence include:
*   **Reason for Absence:** Mr. Tharoor publicly clarified that he was invited to the Mumbai meeting "only one or two days before" it was scheduled to take place. He indicated that such short notice made it impossible to adjust his existing schedule.
*   **Prior Commitment:** He specified that he had "official commitments" in Dubai that had been arranged well in advance and could not be rescheduled on such short notice.
*   **Previous Absences:** This is not the first time Mr. Tharoor has missed a significant party gathering. Earlier in 2022, he also did not attend a follow-up meeting to the party's Chintan Shivir, which was held in Himachal Pradesh. That session focused on implementing resolutions from the Udaipur conclave, aiming at revitalizing the party.
*   **Recent Party Role:** Mr. Tharoor recently contested the election for Congress president, ultimately losing to veteran leader Mallikarjun Kharge. His campaign focused on internal party reforms and greater decentralization.

The recurring theme of Mr. Tharoor's non-attendance at internal strategic meetings, attributed to scheduling conflicts and short-notice invitations, continues to be observed within party circles. While Mr. Tharoor has consistently reiterated his commitment to the Congress party, these instances highlight the logistical challenges of coordinating schedules for high-profile leaders with demanding public and international engagements. His proactive stance during the presidential election has placed him in a visible position, making his participation in all party functions a point of internal observation.

As the Indian National Congress intensifies its preparations for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, its various committees and leaders are expected to convene regularly to finalize strategies. Mr. Tharoor is anticipated to continue his parliamentary duties and public engagements, maintaining his public profile as a key voice within the party. The party leadership and its members will likely continue to navigate the logistical aspects of engaging all prominent figures in crucial internal deliberations as the election cycle progresses.
