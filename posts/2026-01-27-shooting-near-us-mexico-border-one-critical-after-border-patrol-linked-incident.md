A shooting incident near the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego's Otay Mesa area on Thursday, July 7, 2022, resulted in one individual being critically wounded after U.S. Border Patrol agents discharged their firearms. The event occurred shortly after 6 a.m. local time during an encounter between agents and individuals suspected of human smuggling. The injured person was transported to a local hospital where they remain in critical condition.

The incident unfolded when U.S. Border Patrol agents encountered a group of suspected migrants. During this interaction, a suspect operating a vehicle reportedly drove toward the agents. In response to the perceived threat, at least one federal agent discharged their firearm, striking an individual within the vehicle. No U.S. Border Patrol agents sustained injuries during the encounter.

Following the shooting, other individuals present in the vehicle were apprehended. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) released a statement confirming the incident and the involvement of its personnel.

The critical nature of the incident has prompted a multi-agency investigation to ascertain the full details and circumstances surrounding the shooting. Several key law enforcement bodies have initiated probes:
*   The San Diego Police Department is conducting a criminal investigation into the shooting.
*   The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has also launched an inquiry.
*   U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the actions of the agents involved, a standard procedure for incidents involving the use of force.

The Otay Mesa area, located along the international boundary, is a frequently utilized corridor for illegal crossings and smuggling activities, often leading to encounters between law enforcement and individuals attempting to bypass legal entry points. Such incidents involving federal agents' use of force are subject to rigorous review to ensure compliance with established protocols and legal standards. The investigations are ongoing, and further details are expected to emerge as authorities continue their work. The identity of the critically wounded individual has not been released.
