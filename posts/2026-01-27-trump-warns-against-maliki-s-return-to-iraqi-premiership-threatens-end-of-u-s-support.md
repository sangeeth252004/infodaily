Former U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a direct warning regarding the potential return of Nouri al-Maliki to the position of Iraqi Prime Minister. Mr. Trump stated that the United States would cease its support for Iraq should Mr. Maliki assume the premiership again, describing such a development as a "very bad choice." The pronouncement underscores ongoing international interest and potential influence in Iraq's political landscape, particularly from key global powers.

The statement by the former President highlights persistent concerns among some international observers regarding Iraq's governance and stability. Nouri al-Maliki served as Iraq's Prime Minister from 2006 to 2014, a period marked by significant sectarian tensions, the withdrawal of U.S. troops, and the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) group in large parts of the country. His tenure also saw challenges to Iraq's nascent democratic institutions and debates over the concentration of power. His potential re-emergence into the highest executive office remains a point of contention within Iraqi politics and among international allies.

Mr. Trump's warning, though made by a former head of state, carries weight due to his previous foreign policy decisions concerning the Middle East and the enduring bipartisan U.S. interest in Iraqi stability. The United States has provided extensive support to Iraq across various sectors since the 2003 invasion, including military aid, counter-terrorism cooperation, economic assistance, and diplomatic backing. This support has been crucial for Iraq's efforts to rebuild infrastructure, strengthen its security forces, and combat extremist threats. The prospect of ending this support could have significant implications for Iraq's internal stability and its regional standing.

Key considerations surrounding such a development include:
*   **Security Implications:** A cessation of U.S. support could impact Iraq's ability to maintain its military capabilities, particularly in intelligence sharing and specialized training for counter-terrorism operations against remnants of ISIS.
*   **Economic Impact:** U.S. economic aid and investment, while varying over time, contribute to Iraq's development projects and economic stability. A withdrawal could exacerbate existing economic challenges.
*   **Regional Dynamics:** Iraq's political direction holds sway over the broader Middle East. A shift in U.S.-Iraq relations could alter regional power balances and alliances.
*   **Sovereignty Concerns:** Warnings of this nature can also spark debate within Iraq regarding national sovereignty and the right of the Iraqi people to determine their leadership without external pressure.

The political situation in Iraq often involves complex negotiations among various factions, and the selection of a Prime Minister typically follows a protracted process of coalition-building. While Mr. Maliki remains an influential figure in Iraqi politics, any bid for the premiership would face significant internal and external scrutiny. Mr. Trump's statement adds a notable external dimension to these ongoing political deliberations, signaling a potential policy shift from a prominent U.S. political figure should specific leadership choices be made in Baghdad. The ultimate impact of such a warning will depend on future political developments in Iraq and the stance of the current U.S. administration.
