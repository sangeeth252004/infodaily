ABU DHABI, UAE – The National Center of Meteorology (NCM) has issued a weather forecast for the United Arab Emirates, indicating a week of foggy mornings and humid conditions across various regions. Residents and motorists are advised to prepare for reduced visibility, particularly during early morning hours, and take necessary precautions.

According to the NCM’s latest update, the atmospheric conditions are conducive to the formation of fog and mist from late night through to mid-morning over the next several days. These conditions are expected to be most prevalent over coastal and internal areas, with the intensity varying day by day. Reduced horizontal visibility is a primary concern, with the potential for visibility to drop below 1000 meters in some areas affected by dense fog.

The forecast attributes these conditions to high humidity levels, particularly overnight and in the early hours of the morning. Relative humidity is projected to range between 80% to 95% in coastal and internal areas, creating an environment favorable for mist and fog formation as temperatures cool. This pattern is characteristic of transitional weather periods in the region.

Key details from the NCM forecast include:

*   **Fog and Mist:** Expected from Monday through Thursday, primarily between 1:00 AM and 9:00 AM. Coastal cities such as Abu Dhabi and Dubai, alongside internal areas like Al Ain and areas near Al Dhafra, are likely to experience the most significant impact.
*   **Humidity:** Elevated humidity levels will persist, especially during the night and morning across most regions. This will contribute to the formation of mist or light fog.
*   **Temperatures:** Daytime temperatures are forecast to be moderate, ranging from 28°C to 34°C in coastal areas and 30°C to 38°C in internal regions. Nighttime lows are expected to be between 20°C and 25°C in coastal areas, dropping to 15°C to 20°C in mountainous and some internal desert regions.
*   **Winds:** Light to moderate winds are predicted throughout the week, occasionally freshening, which could lead to some blowing dust in exposed areas, though this is not expected to be a dominant feature.
*   **Sea Conditions:** The Arabian Gulf and Oman Sea are expected to experience slight to moderate sea conditions, with no major disturbances forecast.

The NCM has reiterated its advisory for motorists to exercise extreme caution on roads affected by fog and mist. Drivers are urged to reduce speed, maintain a safe distance between vehicles, and use low-beam headlights or fog lights when visibility is impaired. Public health authorities also advise individuals with respiratory sensitivities to take precautions due to potential changes in air quality from mist and dust.

The National Center of Meteorology will continue to monitor the weather situation and issue updates as conditions evolve. Residents are encouraged to stay informed through official NCM channels and local news outlets for the latest weather alerts and guidance. The NCM’s detailed forecasts are available on its official website and through its dedicated mobile applications.
