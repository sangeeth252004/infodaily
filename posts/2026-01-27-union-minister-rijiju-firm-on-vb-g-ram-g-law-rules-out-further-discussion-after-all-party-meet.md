Union Minister Kiren Rijiju recently announced that the government would not entertain further discussion regarding the VB–G RAM G law, following an all-party meeting held ahead of the upcoming parliamentary session. Mr. Rijiju's firm stance indicates the administration's resolve to proceed with the enacted legislation without revisiting its provisions.

Speaking to reporters after the consultative meeting, Minister Rijiju emphasized that the government considers the legislative process for the VB–G RAM G law to be complete. He stated, “We can’t reverse gear now,” signifying a definitive position from the government. This declaration suggests that calls from certain political factions for a re-evaluation or fresh debate on the law's aspects will not be accommodated during the impending session.

The VB–G RAM G law, enacted earlier this year, primarily aims to streamline governance processes and enhance the delivery of public services across various sectors. Since its introduction and passage, the law has been in its implementation phase, with government departments and agencies working to operationalize its mandates. The minister's statement reaffirms the administration's commitment to the law in its current form and its swift execution.

All-party meetings are traditionally convened to foster consensus and facilitate smooth parliamentary proceedings, particularly concerning significant legislation. These platforms are typically used by the government to gauge the mood of the opposition and address concerns regarding proposed or newly enacted laws. In this instance, however, Minister Rijiju's announcement indicates that the meeting served to underscore the government's unwavering commitment to the VB–G RAM G law as it stands, rather than to open avenues for further amendments or protracted debates on its core elements.

*   **Key points from Minister Rijiju's statement:**
    *   Legislative process for VB–G RAM G law is concluded.
    *   No plans for "reversing gear" on the law.
    *   Focus is now on implementation rather than renewed discussion of provisions.
    *   The government's position is firm on the current structure of the law.

The categorical statement by Minister Rijiju sets a clear tone for the upcoming parliamentary session. It suggests that the government intends to prioritize the smooth execution and operationalization of the VB–G RAM G law. Political observers anticipate potential reactions from opposition parties who may have sought further deliberation on the law, indicating that while specific discussion on this legislation may be off the table from the government's perspective, its implications and implementation could still feature in broader legislative and political discourse.
