Public health activists and civil society organizations across India have collectively urged the central government to significantly increase its allocation for the health sector in the upcoming Union Budget 2023-24. The calls, which emerged in late 2022, advocate for at least a doubling of the current public health expenditure, aiming to bolster the nation's healthcare infrastructure and services following lessons learned from recent global health crises. This concerted demand highlights a persistent gap between current spending levels and the requirements for robust universal healthcare access.

The primary objective behind these appeals is to align India's public health spending with international benchmarks and the country's own National Health Policy (NHP) 2017 targets. The NHP 2017 envisioned public health expenditure reaching 2.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025. However, current estimates indicate that India's public health spending has historically hovered around 1.2% to 1.8% of GDP, placing it below many developing and developed nations. Activists argue that this underfunding contributes to high out-of-pocket expenditure for citizens, pushing millions into poverty annually due to healthcare costs.

Specific recommendations put forth by these groups often include:
*   **Increased Central Allocation:** A substantial boost in the central government's share of health spending to support states, which bear a significant portion of healthcare delivery.
*   **Strengthening Primary Healthcare:** Greater investment in Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) to ensure accessible basic healthcare services at the community level, particularly in rural and underserved areas.
*   **Human Resources for Health:** Allocation for recruitment, training, and fair remuneration for doctors, nurses, paramedics, and community health workers, addressing existing shortages.
*   **Public Health Surveillance and Preparedness:** Enhanced funding for disease surveillance systems, laboratory networks, and emergency preparedness mechanisms, drawing directly from experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.
*   **Mental Health Integration:** Dedicated budgets for integrating mental health services into primary healthcare and expanding access to mental health professionals.
*   **Access to Essential Medicines:** Measures to ensure affordable access to essential medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics for all citizens.

Proponents of increased health spending emphasize that a stronger public health system is crucial for achieving equitable health outcomes and fostering economic productivity. The COVID-19 pandemic starkly exposed vulnerabilities in India's healthcare system, including bed shortages, oxygen supply issues, and an overburdened workforce. These activists assert that a significant financial commitment in the budget is not merely an expenditure but an investment in human capital and national resilience.

As the Union Budget 2023-24 approaches, these calls will likely intensify. The government's response to these demands will be closely watched by health policy experts, civil society, and the public, as it will signal the nation's priority for public health and its commitment to achieving its stated health goals. The final budget allocation will determine the immediate direction of India's health sector development and its capacity to address future health challenges.
