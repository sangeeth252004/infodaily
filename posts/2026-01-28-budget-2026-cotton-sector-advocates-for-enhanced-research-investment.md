Agricultural experts and key research institutions across India are advocating for a substantial increase in research and development funding for the cotton sector, urging the government to place innovation at the core of policymaking for Budget 2026. This concerted call emphasizes that robust scientific advancements are crucial for overcoming persistent challenges and ensuring the long-term viability and global competitiveness of Indian cotton.

India stands as one of the world's largest producers of cotton, with the sector employing millions of farmers and forming a foundational pillar of the nation's textile industry. Despite its significance, the industry faces numerous hurdles, including declining productivity, the emergence of pest resistance, particularly from the pink bollworm, and the escalating impacts of climate change such as droughts and unpredictable weather patterns. Experts contend that without a renewed focus on strategic research, the sector risks stagnation in output and quality, directly affecting farmer livelihoods and the economy.

Dr. Y. G. Prasad, Director of the ICAR-Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR), recently highlighted the imperative of integrating cutting-edge research into national agricultural policy. During a recent public statement, Dr. Prasad underscored the need for enhanced government investment in developing climate-resilient and pest-resistant cotton varieties. He further advocated for advancements in sustainable farming practices designed to reduce the environmental footprint and improve resource efficiency within cotton cultivation. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), under which CICR operates, consistently emphasizes the role of science in agricultural transformation.

The proposed research priorities encompass a broad spectrum of areas critical for modernizing the cotton industry:

*   **Genetic Improvement:** Developing new high-yielding cotton hybrids and genetically modified varieties that possess enhanced resistance to prevalent pests and diseases, and improved fiber quality. This includes exploring alternatives or advancements to existing Bt cotton technology.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Investing in comprehensive research for integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, biological controls, and advanced monitoring systems to effectively mitigate losses caused by notorious pests like the pink bollworm.
*   **Climate Resilience:** Breeding cotton varieties specifically adapted to withstand increasing environmental stressors such as drought, extreme heat, and erratic rainfall patterns, ensuring stability in production.
*   **Sustainable Practices:** Research and promotion of water-saving irrigation technologies, advanced soil health management techniques, and innovative organic cultivation methods to minimize environmental impact.
*   **Digital Agriculture Integration:** Exploring the application of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and precision farming techniques for optimized input management, accurate yield prediction, and efficient resource allocation.
*   **Post-Harvest Technologies:** Developing solutions for efficient ginning, improved storage, and value addition to cotton products, enhancing returns for farmers.

Increased budgetary allocation towards these pivotal research avenues is projected to yield significant benefits across the entire cotton value chain. These include higher farm productivity, substantial improvements in fiber quality, reduced input costs for cultivators, and greater environmental sustainability. Ultimately, such strategic investments are expected to bolster farmer incomes, strengthen India's position as a leading global cotton producer and exporter, and ensure the long-term prosperity of the domestic textile industry.

These detailed recommendations are anticipated to be formally presented to the Union Finance Ministry as part of the pre-budget consultation process for Budget 2026. The government's forthcoming decisions on these proposals will be instrumental in shaping the future trajectory of agricultural policy and funding priorities for India's vital cotton sector.
