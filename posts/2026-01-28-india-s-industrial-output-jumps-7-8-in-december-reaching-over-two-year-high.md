India's industrial output, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), recorded a significant jump of 7.8% in December. This surge represents an over two-year high, indicating a broad-based recovery across key sectors of the economy. The robust performance data was released recently by the National Statistical Office (NSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.

The December figures mark a notable acceleration in industrial activity, following a revised 2.5% increase in industrial production during November. This consistent upward trend highlights improving economic momentum in the country. In comparison, the IIP growth for December of the preceding year stood at 1.0%, underscoring the substantial year-on-year improvement and the current pace of expansion.

The manufacturing sector, which holds the largest weight in the IIP at 77.63%, was a primary driver of this expansion, registering a growth of 7.9% in December. This substantial increase indicates a strong revival in factory output across various industries. The mining sector also demonstrated healthy growth at 9.7%, while the electricity generation sector expanded by 5.2%, all contributing significantly to the overall IIP figures.

Key contributors to December's industrial growth include:
*   **Manufacturing Sector (77.63% weight):** Grew by 7.9%, showcasing broad-based recovery in factory production.
*   **Mining Sector (14.37% weight):** Registered 9.7% growth, reflecting sustained demand for raw materials.
*   **Electricity Sector (7.90% weight):** Expanded by 5.2%, aligning with increased industrial activity and consumption across various segments.

An analysis of the IIP by use-based classification further illustrates the pervasive nature of the recovery:
*   **Capital Goods:** This segment, crucial for investment and future industrial capacity, recorded a significant expansion of 19.5%. This indicates increased capital expenditure and capacity creation by businesses.
*   **Primary Goods:** Expanded by 9.6%, reflecting strong foundational demand from downstream industries.
*   **Infrastructure/Construction Goods:** Grew by 10.1%, suggesting sustained momentum in government and private sector project execution.
*   **Consumer Durables:** Experienced growth of 7.0%, potentially indicating improving consumer sentiment and discretionary spending.
*   **Consumer Non-Durables:** Grew by 3.5%, showing steady, albeit slower, demand for essential goods.
*   **Intermediate Goods:** Saw growth of 5.8%, supporting production across a wide range of manufacturing and other industries.

These figures collectively point to a strengthening of industrial activity across a diverse range of categories, moving beyond specific pockets of growth. The sustained positive momentum in industrial output is a key indicator for India's economic health. Economists and policymakers will closely monitor upcoming IIP data to assess the durability of this recovery and its potential impact on broader economic metrics, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. The December figures provide a robust signal for the continuation of economic expansion into the new year.
