Brampton, Ontario – Varun Kulkarni, a 30-year-old Indian-origin man residing in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, was arrested and charged with sexual assault by Peel Regional Police on October 25, 2022. The charges stem from an investigation into alleged incidents occurring after individuals responded to online job advertisements. Kulkarni was subsequently released on bail the following day, October 26, 2022.

The arrest and subsequent charges were announced by Peel Regional Police, who initiated an investigation following reports of alleged sexual assaults. The incidents reportedly took place after victims responded to online job postings for "modelling" or "promotional" work. The alleged assaults are said to have occurred during the "interview process" or during "photoshoots" associated with these advertised roles.

Police have stated that they believe there may be additional victims who have not yet come forward. The nature of the allegations has prompted authorities to issue a public safety appeal, urging anyone with relevant information or those who believe they may have been a victim to contact their Special Victims Unit. This proactive measure underscores the seriousness with which law enforcement is treating the ongoing investigation into these allegations.

The legal process following an arrest and charges in Canada typically involves judicial review, where a judge or justice of the peace determines whether the accused should be released from custody while awaiting trial. In Kulkarni's case, he was granted bail and released under conditions, as is customary for many non-capital offenses, often including restrictions on contact with alleged victims and reporting requirements to ensure public safety and compliance with judicial orders. The specifics of Kulkarni's bail conditions were not publicly detailed by police.

Key details surrounding the case include:
*   **Accused:** Varun Kulkarni, 30, of Brampton, Ontario.
*   **Charges:** Sexual assault.
*   **Arrest Date:** October 25, 2022.
*   **Bail Release Date:** October 26, 2022.
*   **Investigating Agency:** Peel Regional Police, Special Victims Unit.
*   **Alleged Context:** Incidents reportedly occurred after victims responded to online job advertisements for "modelling" or "promotional" work, specifically during "interview processes" or "photoshoots."
*   **Police Action:** Authorities are actively appealing to the public for further information and potential victims.

The investigation by Peel Regional Police remains ongoing. Kulkarni is scheduled to appear in court at a future date, where the legal proceedings will continue. The police encourage anyone with information pertinent to this case, or who may have experienced similar circumstances, to contact their Special Victims Unit or Crime Stoppers anonymously. This incident highlights the importance of caution when engaging with online job advertisements, particularly those for less conventional roles, and the necessity of due diligence in verifying the legitimacy and safety of such opportunities.
