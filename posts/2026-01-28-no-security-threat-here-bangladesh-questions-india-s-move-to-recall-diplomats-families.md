Dhaka, Bangladesh — The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry officially questioned India's decision to recall the families of its diplomatic staff from Dhaka in October 2022, asserting that the security situation in the capital presented no specific threat. Bangladeshi officials communicated their stance following reports of India's decision to temporarily move dependents of personnel stationed at the Indian High Commission.

The move by India prompted diplomatic queries from Bangladesh, which maintained that security arrangements for foreign missions and their staff remained robust. Senior Bangladeshi officials indicated that they were not made aware of any concrete security intelligence that would necessitate such a recall, expressing surprise at the measure.

*   **Official Stance:** Bangladesh’s Foreign Ministry conveyed through various channels that it considers the overall security environment in Dhaka to be normal and under control.
*   **No Specific Threat:** Officials reiterated that there was no specific threat assessment or intelligence report indicating an imminent danger to foreign diplomats or their families.
*   **Bilateral Importance:** The questioning underscores the sensitivity of diplomatic protocols and the high value placed on stable bilateral relations between the two neighboring countries.

The diplomatic development occurred against a backdrop of public demonstrations in Dhaka during the period. These protests, reportedly organized by Islamist groups, were primarily directed at France following remarks made by French President Emmanuel Macron concerning Islam. While these demonstrations caused public disruption and heightened security vigilance in certain areas of the capital, Bangladeshi authorities emphasized that measures were in place to ensure the safety of all residents, including the diplomatic community.

Diplomatic sources indicated that while sovereign nations make independent security assessments for their missions abroad, such actions can sometimes signal a perceived deterioration of security, potentially impacting international perceptions. Bangladesh highlighted its commitment to providing a secure environment for all diplomatic missions, in accordance with international conventions.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs did not issue a public statement detailing the specific reasons for the recall at the time, though such measures are typically taken based on internal security assessments concerning the safety and well-being of diplomatic personnel and their dependents. The situation has prompted ongoing dialogue between the foreign ministries of both nations to clarify concerns and reaffirm mutual cooperation. Moving forward, both countries are expected to continue their diplomatic engagement to ensure clarity and address any lingering concerns regarding security and bilateral ties.
