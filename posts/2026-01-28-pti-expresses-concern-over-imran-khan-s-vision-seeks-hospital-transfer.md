Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) officials have expressed grave concern over the deteriorating vision of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The party has formally requested that Khan be transferred to a hospital for immediate and specialized medical examination and treatment, citing fears that he is in "grave danger" of losing his eyesight. This development adds to ongoing discussions surrounding the health and detention conditions of the prominent political figure.

Imran Khan, who served as Pakistan's Prime Minister from 2018 to 2022, has been in custody since August 2023 following his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case. Since his arrest, PTI has repeatedly raised alarms about his physical well-being and access to adequate healthcare while in jail. The latest concern centers specifically on his vision, which party representatives claim has worsened significantly during his detention.

According to statements released by PTI, medical professionals have indicated that Khan's eyesight may be severely compromised without timely and expert intervention. The party asserts that the medical facilities available within the jail premises are insufficient to address the complexities of Khan's reported ocular issues, necessitating a transfer to a fully equipped hospital where specialists can conduct thorough assessments and administer appropriate treatment.

Key details surrounding PTI's concerns include:
*   **Deteriorating Vision:** PTI officials assert that Imran Khan's eyesight has experienced a noticeable decline during his incarceration.
*   **"Grave Danger" Warning:** The party has used strong language, stating that Khan is at "grave danger" of potentially losing his vision without immediate expert care.
*   **Request for Hospital Transfer:** A formal request has been made to relevant authorities to move Khan to a hospital equipped to handle specialized ophthalmic conditions.
*   **Inadequate Jail Facilities:** PTI contends that the current medical setup at the jail lacks the necessary specialists and equipment to properly diagnose and treat Khan's reported eye condition.

The plea for Khan's transfer underscores broader concerns raised by PTI and human rights advocates regarding the healthcare provisions for high-profile prisoners in Pakistan. The former prime minister's health has been a recurring point of contention, with his legal team and political party advocating for comprehensive medical evaluations. The current situation places renewed focus on the responsibilities of the state to ensure adequate medical care for all detainees, particularly those with pre-existing or developing health issues.

Authorities, including the jail administration and the government, are expected to review PTI's request. Any decision on Khan's transfer to a hospital will likely be subject to judicial oversight and could have significant political implications, given his continued influence and the ongoing legal challenges he faces. The situation remains under close observation by his supporters, the media, and international observers.
