Mumbai – SBI Research, the economic research wing of the State Bank of India, has released its detailed budget expectations for the financial year 2026, forecasting a continued commitment to fiscal discipline and robust capital expenditure as key drivers for India's economic growth. The report projects that the government will aim to maintain the fiscal deficit at 4.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by FY26, leveraging capital investment to navigate the prevailing global economic uncertainties.

The comprehensive analysis underscores the anticipated role of capital expenditure (capex) as a primary growth anchor for the Indian economy. SBI Research estimates that the government's capital outlay will likely be maintained at approximately Rs 10 lakh crore in FY26. This significant investment is expected to generate a substantial multiplier effect, which the report estimates at 4.5, indicating a strong return on public investment into infrastructure and productive assets. The report highlights that capital outlay historically demonstrates a more profound impact on economic growth compared to revenue expenditure.

Supporting this outlook, the research points to a robust performance in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), which recorded a growth of 10.6% in 2022-23. This sustained focus on capital formation is considered crucial for enhancing productive capacity and fostering long-term economic expansion. The report's projections suggest that India is on track to become the third-largest economy globally by 2027, provided these policy trajectories are maintained.

Key projections and observations from the SBI Research report include:
*   **Fiscal Deficit Target:** A commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by FY26, signaling fiscal prudence.
*   **Capital Outlay:** Maintenance of a high capital expenditure figure, estimated at Rs 10 lakh crore for FY26, intended to stimulate economic activity and job creation.
*   **Multiplier Effect:** Capital expenditure is expected to yield a multiplier effect of 4.5, indicating its efficiency in driving broader economic benefits.
*   **Rural Economic Health:** Significant improvement in rural wage growth over the past two years, contributing to enhanced purchasing power in rural areas.
*   **Urban Employment Trends:** A decline in the urban unemployment rate, falling to 6.6% in Q2FY24 from 7.2% in Q1FY24, suggesting improving labor market conditions in urban centers.
*   **Real GDP Growth:** A projection of 6.7% real GDP growth for FY24, reflecting a stable and positive economic trajectory for the current fiscal year.
*   **Policy Stance:** The report anticipates the government will prioritize fiscal prudence, suggesting that potential populist measures would not significantly deviate the budgetary direction, even with impending electoral cycles.

The findings from SBI Research provide a detailed perspective on the potential direction of India’s economic policy, particularly concerning public finance and investment. These projections offer valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and market participants as preparations for the future budget cycle commence, emphasizing a consistent approach to economic management amidst evolving global economic landscapes. The sustained focus on capital expenditure is viewed as essential for strengthening India's economic resilience and achieving its long-term growth aspirations.
