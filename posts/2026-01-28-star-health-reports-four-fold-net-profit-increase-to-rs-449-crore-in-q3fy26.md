Star Health and Allied Insurance Company Limited (Star Health) has reported a substantial four-fold increase in its net profit, reaching Rs 449 crore for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2026 (Q3FY26). The Chennai-based specialized health insurer disclosed these figures following a board meeting held on January 24, 2026, attributing the strong performance to robust premium growth and enhanced operational efficiency.

This notable rise in profitability marks a significant improvement from the Rs 112.25 crore net profit recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year, Q3FY25. The company's Gross Written Premium (GWP) also demonstrated solid growth, climbing to Rs 3,250 crore in Q3FY26, an increase of 18.2% compared to Rs 2,750 crore in Q3FY25. This expansion in premium income was reportedly driven by sustained demand for health insurance products across various segments and the company's expanding distribution network.

Underwriting performance, a key indicator for insurance companies, showed a positive trend. Star Health reported an underwriting profit of Rs 98 crore in Q3FY26, a turnaround from an underwriting loss of Rs 45 crore in Q3FY25. This improvement is largely attributed to effective claims management strategies and a stable claims incurred ratio, which stood at 66.5% for the quarter, down from 72.8% in Q3FY25. Investment income also contributed positively, rising by 15% year-on-year to Rs 215 crore.

The company's combined ratio, which measures underwriting profitability by adding the loss ratio and expense ratio, improved significantly to 96.8% in Q3FY26, compared to 103.5% in Q3FY25. A combined ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit. Furthermore, Star Health maintained a healthy solvency ratio of 2.15x as of December 31, 2025, well above the regulatory requirement of 1.50x, reflecting its strong financial stability and capacity to meet future obligations.

Key financial highlights for Star Health in Q3FY26 include:
*   **Net Profit:** Rs 449 crore (up from Rs 112.25 crore in Q3FY25)
*   **Gross Written Premium (GWP):** Rs 3,250 crore (up 18.2% from Rs 2,750 crore in Q3FY25)

Star Health anticipates continued expansion in the health insurance market, driven by increasing awareness and demand for comprehensive health coverage. The insurer indicated its focus would remain on strategic market penetration, product innovation, and maintaining operational efficiencies to support its full-year financial targets.
