West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee on Saturday, May 7, 2022, floated a political conspiracy theory regarding the death of former BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Ajit Kumar Singh. Speaking at a press conference in Kolkata, Ms. Banerjee alleged that Mr. Singh had "died under mysterious circumstances" after expressing an intention to leave the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The Chief Minister's statements suggested a pattern of political pressure and alleged coercion within the national political landscape. She explicitly connected Mr. Singh's reported desire to exit the BJP with his subsequent demise, asking, "Is it only coincidence? We want to know." Her comments underscored concerns about the transparency surrounding the deaths of politicians and the treatment of dissenting voices within parties.

Ms. Banerjee expanded on her allegations, citing other instances she perceived as examples of political coercion. She mentioned situations involving Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and party leader Kunal Ghosh, implying they too had faced pressure. She stated, "This is what is happening to all those who want to leave the party. This (coercion) happened with Mahua too. It happened with Kunal. What happened to him (Ajit Kumar Singh) is a conspiracy." She further elaborated on challenges faced by her own party leaders in Tripura and obstacles encountered during her personal campaigning, describing these as indicative of a deteriorating democratic environment.

The Trinamool Congress chairperson's remarks also came in the broader context of ongoing political developments in Maharashtra. She referenced Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray's postponed visit to Ayodhya, which had faced opposition from BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Ms. Banerjee asserted that obstacles to Mr. Thackeray's visit demonstrated a lack of democratic space and freedom of expression. She contended that "They (BJP) are afraid of those who are strong," portraying the incidents as attempts to stifle dissent and control political narratives.
