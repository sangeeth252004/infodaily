The Delhi High Court has directed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to submit its stand on a petition seeking to halt the implementation of new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) for pilots. These revised regulations, which govern pilot duty and rest periods, are slated to become effective on June 1, 2024. The petition, filed by the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP), argues that certain aspects of these updated norms could compromise flight safety by potentially increasing pilot fatigue, despite the DGCA's stated objectives for the changes.

The DGCA, India's aviation safety regulator, notified the revised FDTL regulations in December 2023. These amendments were presented as a measure to enhance safety, particularly concerning night flying operations, and to align Indian aviation standards more closely with international best practices. Key provisions introduced by the DGCA's revised framework include an increase in weekly rest periods for pilots from 36 hours to 48 hours and a reduction in the maximum flight duty period for night operations to 10 hours from the previous 13 hours. The new regulations also mandate airlines to implement robust fatigue management systems.

However, the Federation of Indian Pilots contends that while some changes appear beneficial, the overall structure of the new rules contains allowances that could lead to increased operational pressures and pilot exhaustion. The FIP's plea highlights concerns that specific provisions might permit longer cumulative duty periods than what is considered safe under current scientific understanding of fatigue, potentially negating the benefits of increased rest in other areas. They argue that the previous 2019 FDTL regulations, while having areas for improvement, were more robust in preventing extreme duty cycles. The petition specifically challenges the scientific basis and practical implications of certain revised duty extensions.

The High Court's directive requires the DGCA to file a detailed affidavit outlining its position, the rationale behind the new norms, and its response to the specific safety concerns raised by the FIP. This legal development underscores the ongoing tension between regulatory bodies aiming to update aviation standards and pilot associations advocating for what they perceive as uncompromising safety thresholds. The court has scheduled the next hearing to review the DGCA's submission and further deliberate on the matter.

Specific details of the new FDTL norms and points of contention include:

*   **Effective Date**: June 1, 2024, for the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations.
*   **Key DGCA Changes**:
    *   Increase in mandatory weekly rest period for pilots from 36 hours to 48 hours.
    *   Reduction in the maximum flight duty period for night operations from 13 hours to 10 hours.
    *   Introduction of mandatory reporting systems for pilot fatigue.
    *   Requirement for airlines to submit and implement approved fatigue management systems.
*   **FIP's Primary Concerns**:
    *   Allegations of allowances for longer cumulative duty periods in specific operational scenarios.
    *   Claims of insufficient consideration for the physiological impact of increased flight time allowances in certain contexts.
    *   Potential for increased pilot fatigue despite other beneficial changes to rest periods.
    *   Challenges to the scientific validity of certain revised duty extensions proposed in the new regulations.

The court's decision will have significant implications for flight operations across Indian airlines, potentially influencing pilot scheduling, operational costs, and, crucially, the framework for aviation safety in the country. The outcome will be closely watched by airlines, pilots, and the broader civil aviation sector as the legal proceedings unfold.
