NEW DELHI – The Economic Survey of India has identified significant vulnerabilities for the Indian Rupee stemming from evolving global geopolitical dynamics and a projected "strategic power gap" in the year 2025. This assessment, detailed in a recent explanation from the Survey, underscores the external pressures that could impact India's currency stability and broader economic landscape.

According to the Economic Survey, the Rupee's performance is increasingly intertwined with the complexities of international relations and shifts in global power structures. Geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts, trade disputes, and supply chain disruptions, are cited as primary factors that can induce volatility in foreign exchange markets. Such events frequently lead to capital outflows from emerging economies, increase the cost of essential imports like crude oil, and dampen investor sentiment, all of which exert downward pressure on the domestic currency. The Survey's findings highlight that India, despite its robust economic fundamentals, remains susceptible to these external shocks due to its integration into the global economy.

A key concern raised by the Economic Survey centers on a forecasted "strategic power gap" around 2025. While specific details regarding the nature of this gap were not extensively elaborated upon in public statements, the Survey suggests it refers to a period of heightened international uncertainty or a potential vacuum in global leadership and cooperation. Such a scenario is anticipated to amplify existing geopolitical risks, potentially leading to increased instability across financial markets worldwide. For the Rupee, this could translate into intensified volatility, challenges in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, and difficulties for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in managing monetary policy to ensure price stability and economic growth.

Key observations from the Economic Survey include:
*   **External Pressures:** Global energy price fluctuations, particularly crude oil, pose a consistent threat to India's current account balance and inflation.
*   **Capital Flows:** Shifts in global interest rates and investor risk appetite, often influenced by geopolitical developments, directly impact foreign portfolio investment into India.
*   **Trade Dynamics:** Disruptions to international trade routes and rising protectionism contribute to global economic uncertainty, affecting India's export potential and import costs.
*   **Currency Volatility:** The combination of these factors creates an environment where the Rupee could experience periods of significant depreciation against major global currencies.
*   **2025 Projection:** The strategic power gap identified for 2025 is presented as a critical window of vulnerability requiring proactive economic and policy preparedness.

Looking ahead, the Economic Survey implicitly suggests a need for vigilant monitoring of global developments and strategic policy interventions. The Reserve Bank of India and the government are expected to continue employing a range of tools, including managing foreign exchange reserves, implementing fiscal measures, and fostering domestic economic resilience, to mitigate the impact of these projected external challenges. The assessment serves as a reminder for policymakers to reinforce buffers against global uncertainties and prepare for a potentially turbulent period in international geopolitics and economic stability.
