India has actively pursued Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to deepen its global economic integration and boost its foreign trade, with its strategic approach evolving significantly over the past two decades. This progression highlights India's ambition to enhance market access, attract investment, and position itself more prominently within global supply chains. Key milestones in this journey include the early establishment of agreements like the Framework Agreement on a Free Trade Area between India and Thailand, signed in 2003, and the ongoing comprehensive negotiations with major economic blocs, notably the European Union.

The India-Thailand FTA (ITFTA) represented an early phase of India’s focused regional trade engagement, falling under the broader "Look East" policy. Signed on October 9, 2003, in Bangkok, Thailand, the framework agreement laid the groundwork for phased tariff reductions on a range of goods. The initial phase, covering 82 "Early Harvest" items, became operational in September 2004, facilitating preferential trade in specific sectors. This bilateral agreement later broadened into the India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, implemented for goods in 2009, reflecting a strategy to engage with key regional economies. Such agreements aimed to leverage geographical proximity and reduce trade barriers for mutual economic benefit.

Over time, India's trade strategy has shifted towards more comprehensive and economically significant partnerships, moving beyond individual nations or regional groupings to engaging with larger, developed markets. This pivot reflects a desire to secure broader market access for Indian goods and services, attract advanced technology and investment, and integrate more deeply into global value chains. Recent years have seen a renewed impetus in this direction, marked by both successfully concluded agreements and high-profile ongoing negotiations.

*   **India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA):** Signed in February 2022 and operationalized in May 2022, this agreement aims to boost bilateral non-oil trade to $100 billion by 2027.
*   **India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA):** Signed in April 2022 and implemented in December 2022, the ECTA provides duty-free access for a wide range of Indian products to the Australian market.
*   **India-United Kingdom FTA:** Negotiations for a comprehensive FTA with the UK are ongoing, with multiple rounds completed since their launch in January 2022, covering areas such as goods, services, and investment.

Among the most significant current negotiations are those with the European Union. Talks for a comprehensive India-EU Free Trade Agreement, officially known as the Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), were re-launched in June 2022 after an eight-year hiatus. The EU is one of India's largest trading partners, and a successful FTA could significantly impact bilateral trade and investment. These negotiations are complex, encompassing trade in goods, services, investment protection, intellectual property rights, geographical indications, and sustainable development provisions. Both sides aim to reduce tariffs, eliminate non-tariff barriers, and facilitate easier movement of professionals, with the potential to unlock substantial economic opportunities.

The renewed focus on securing large-scale FTAs indicates India's strategic push to enhance its economic competitiveness and diversify its global trade footprint. While agreements like the ITFTA established foundational trade relationships, the ongoing discussions with economic giants like the European Union underscore India's elevated ambitions for global trade integration. The outcomes of these high-stakes negotiations are anticipated to significantly shape India's future economic trajectory and its role in the international trading system.
