A recent Economic Survey presented by the Government of India has warned of significant global economic vulnerabilities, citing escalating tariff wars and a potential "AI bubble" as key threats. The report suggests these combined factors could lead to a global crisis potentially more severe than the 2008 financial meltdown, and outlines strategic recommendations for India to navigate these complex challenges. The findings underscore the interconnectedness of the global economy and the need for proactive policy measures to safeguard national interests.

The Survey identifies the resurgence of protectionist policies and subsequent tariff wars as a major destabilizing force. Such measures disrupt established global supply chains, increase manufacturing costs, and reduce international trade volumes. For an emerging economy like India, heavily integrated into the global trading system, prolonged trade conflicts can impede export growth, affect foreign investment inflows, and exert pressure on domestic industries. The report emphasizes the potential for these trade frictions to escalate into broader geopolitical tensions, further complicating economic recovery and stability worldwide.

Simultaneously, the Survey highlights concerns regarding a speculative "AI bubble" within the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence sector. This refers to a scenario where the valuations of AI companies and related technologies surge ahead of their fundamental profitability or widespread market adoption. Historical parallels, such as the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, suggest that such rapid asset price inflation can be followed by sharp corrections, impacting investor confidence, venture capital funding, and the broader technology sector. A potential burst could have ripple effects across global financial markets and economies heavily reliant on tech investments, including India's burgeoning digital economy.

The report's assertion that these looming crises could be "worse than 2008" points to a confluence of factors beyond just financial instability. The 2008 crisis was primarily driven by a collapse in the housing market and subsequent banking failures. The current threats, according to the Survey, involve broader systemic issues: a fragmentation of global trade (tariff wars), and a potential speculative correction in a transformative technology sector (AI bubble), alongside persistent geopolitical uncertainties. The combination of these elements presents a multi-faceted challenge, requiring nuanced and comprehensive policy responses.

To mitigate these risks and ensure continued economic resilience, the Economic Survey proposes a multi-pronged strategy for India. Key recommendations include:

*   **Strengthening Domestic Demand:** Focusing on policies that boost internal consumption and investment to reduce over-reliance on volatile global markets.
*   **Diversifying Trade Relationships:** Exploring new markets and strengthening existing ties with a broader range of countries to insulate against concentrated trade disputes.
*   **Fiscal Prudence:** Maintaining a stable fiscal deficit and public debt to create headroom for counter-cyclical measures if an economic downturn occurs.
*   **Investing in Research and Development:** Promoting innovation and indigenous technological capabilities, particularly in AI, to harness its benefits while mitigating risks associated with speculative market behavior.
*   **Human Capital Development:** Skilling and reskilling the workforce to adapt to evolving technological landscapes and reduce potential job displacement from AI advancements.
*   **Vigilant Monitoring:** Continuously assessing global economic indicators, trade policy shifts, and financial market movements to enable timely policy adjustments.

The findings from the Economic Survey serve as a critical assessment of the global economic landscape, urging policymakers in India to adopt a proactive and adaptive approach. The emphasis remains on fostering sustainable growth, enhancing economic stability, and preparing for potential global headwinds in an increasingly uncertain international environment. Policy implementation based on these recommendations will be crucial for navigating the identified challenges.
