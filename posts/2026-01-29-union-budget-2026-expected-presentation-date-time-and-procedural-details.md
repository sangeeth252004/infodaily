The Union Budget for the Fiscal Year 2026-27 is expected to be presented by the Union Finance Minister in Parliament House, New Delhi, on February 1, 2026. Adhering to established parliamentary practice, the presentation typically commences at 11:00 AM Indian Standard Time (IST). This annual financial exercise outlines the Government of India’s projected revenues and expenditures, along with its fiscal policy proposals for the upcoming financial year, which runs from April 1, 2026, to March 31, 2027.

The Union Budget serves as the government's comprehensive financial blueprint, detailing economic priorities, allocation of resources, taxation proposals, and expenditure plans across various sectors. Its timely presentation is critical for setting the economic direction of the country and ensuring adequate time for parliamentary scrutiny and subsequent implementation before the new fiscal year begins. The practice of presenting the budget on February 1st was initiated in 2017 by the then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, shifting from the traditional last working day of February. This change aimed to facilitate an earlier completion of the budgetary process, allowing ministries and departments to commence project implementation from April 1st without delays.

The presentation itself is a significant parliamentary event. It begins with the Finance Minister's budget speech, delivered in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament). This speech elaborates on the government's economic performance, future outlook, and key policy initiatives, alongside detailed proposals for revenue generation and expenditure. Following the speech, various budget documents are formally tabled in both Houses of Parliament. Prior to the public presentation, a traditional 'Halwa ceremony' is often held, marking the final stage of budget preparation and signifying a period of intensive work leading up to its disclosure.

Key documents presented alongside the Finance Minister's speech include:
*   **Annual Financial Statement (AFS):** The core document mandated by Article 112 of the Constitution, detailing estimated receipts and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year.
*   **Demands for Grants (DFG):** Detailed estimates of expenditure for each ministry and department, requiring parliamentary approval.
*   **Finance Bill:** Enacting the government's financial proposals for the upcoming fiscal year, including taxation changes.
*   **Macroeconomic Framework Statement:** Providing an assessment of the economy's prospects.
*   **Medium-term Fiscal Policy cum Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement:** Outlining the government's fiscal management strategy.
*   **Expenditure Budget and Receipts Budget:** Detailed breakdowns of expenditure and revenue projections.

The Union Budget plays a pivotal role in shaping India's economic landscape, influencing market dynamics, investment decisions, and the daily lives of citizens. It outlines the government's commitment to various sectors such as infrastructure, defence, agriculture, healthcare, and education, through specific allocations and policy announcements. Pre-budget consultations involving various stakeholders, including industry associations, trade unions, economists, and state representatives, typically precede the finalization of the budget, providing input for policy considerations.

Following its presentation, the Union Budget undergoes extensive parliamentary debate and discussion in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha (Upper House). This process includes a general discussion, detailed scrutiny of Demands for Grants by departmental standing committees, and voting on the Demands for Grants in the Lok Sabha. The Finance Bill is then passed by Parliament. Upon receiving the President's assent, the budget and its provisions become law, officially taking effect from the commencement of the new fiscal year on April 1, 2026.
