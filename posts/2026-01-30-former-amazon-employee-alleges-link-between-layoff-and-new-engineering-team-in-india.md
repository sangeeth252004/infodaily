Layla Amjadi, a former Senior Product Manager on Amazon’s Alexa team, initiated widespread discussion on November 16, 2022, by sharing a screenshot on LinkedIn. The image, purportedly an internal Amazon announcement, detailed the establishment of a "new engineering team in India" with a mission to develop a "1P-like offering to customers." Amjadi's post alleged a connection between the timing of her layoff and the announcement of this new team, sparking conversations about corporate hiring strategies during periods of workforce reduction.

Amjadi's public post came shortly after her own employment termination from Amazon's Devices and Services division, which includes the Alexa team. Her LinkedIn caption, "Just yesterday, I got laid off from Amazon. Then, I see this...," highlighted the perceived proximity of these events. The screenshot specifically referenced a new team in India focused on delivering a "first-party (1P) like offering," suggesting a strategic shift or expansion in certain operational areas.

This incident emerged amidst a broader context of significant workforce adjustments within Amazon. Reports from the same period indicated that Amazon was preparing to lay off approximately 10,000 employees across various departments. The Devices and Services organization, responsible for products like Alexa, Kindle, and Fire TV, was specifically identified as one of the divisions most affected by these reductions.

*   **Employee Role:** Layla Amjadi served as a Senior Product Manager within the Alexa team at Amazon.
*   **Timing of Events:** Amjadi's layoff occurred around November 15, 2022, with her LinkedIn post sharing the internal screenshot appearing on November 16, 2022.
*   **Screenshot Content:** The alleged internal communication mentioned the formation of a "new engineering team in India" tasked with bringing a "1P-like offering" to customers.
*   **Corporate Response:** Amazon did not issue an immediate public comment specifically addressing Amjadi's allegation or the content of the shared internal screenshot at the time of the reporting.

The allegations raised by Amjadi underscore ongoing industry discussions regarding global talent sourcing, cost management, and the transparency of corporate decision-making during periods of economic uncertainty. Other major technology companies, including Meta, Salesforce, and Twitter, also announced significant layoffs around the same timeframe, indicating a sector-wide trend of workforce restructuring. These events have led to increased scrutiny from employees and the public regarding how technology companies manage their global workforces and strategic expansions alongside layoffs.

The situation continues to highlight the evolving landscape of global tech employment, prompting ongoing examination of corporate strategies that balance domestic workforce changes with international team development. Future developments will likely include continued observation of tech sector hiring and layoff patterns, particularly concerning the geographic distribution of engineering and product development teams.
