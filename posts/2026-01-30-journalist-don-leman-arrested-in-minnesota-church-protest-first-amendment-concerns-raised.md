Veteran journalist Don Leman, executive editor for The National File, was arrested and subsequently charged with misdemeanor unlawful assembly in Minnesota following his coverage of a protest outside the Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis. The incident, which occurred on Saturday, March 5, 2022, and led to Leman's release the following Sunday morning, has ignited discussions regarding press freedom and journalists' rights under the First Amendment.

Leman's arrest followed a clash between participants of a Catholic rosary rally and counter-protesters identified as members of Antifa and Black Lives Matter. The journalist's legal representation asserts that Leman was engaged in reporting activities and not participating in the protest itself, making his arrest a direct challenge to constitutional protections for the press.

Key details surrounding the event include:
*   **Date of Protest:** Saturday, March 5, 2022, at the Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis.
*   **Arrest and Release:** Leman was arrested late Saturday night or early Sunday morning and released on Sunday morning.
*   **Charges:** He faces a charge of misdemeanor unlawful assembly.
*   **Journalistic Role:** Leman's legal counsel, Jonathan Miller, stated that Leman was "working as a journalist" during the events and described the arrest as "a violation of the First Amendment."
*   **Prior Incident:** Earlier on the day of the protest, Leman reported being pepper-sprayed in the face while covering the confrontation.
*   **Clarification:** The incident involves Don Leman of The National File, distinct from CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was not involved.

The arrest has drawn attention to the boundaries between reporting and participation during public demonstrations, especially when tensions are high. Lawyers representing Leman contend that his presence was solely for documenting the events, a protected activity under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The legal team is expected to challenge the charge, emphasizing the importance of protecting journalists' ability to cover news without fear of arrest, particularly in politically charged environments.

Further legal proceedings will likely scrutinize the specifics of Leman's actions at the scene and the basis for the unlawful assembly charge. The outcome of this case could establish precedents for how law enforcement interacts with members of the press covering protests and demonstrations in Minnesota and potentially nationwide.
