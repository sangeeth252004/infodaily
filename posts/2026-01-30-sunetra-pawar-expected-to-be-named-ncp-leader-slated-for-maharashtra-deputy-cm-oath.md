Sunetra Pawar is slated to be named the new leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) faction and is scheduled to take oath as Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister on the day following the announcement, according to a statement by senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal. The announcement by Bhujbal indicates a significant political development within the state's ruling coalition, potentially solidifying the position of the Ajit Pawar-led faction of the NCP within the Maharashtra government.

The impending appointments come amidst a dynamic political landscape in Maharashtra, where the NCP, led by current Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, is a key constituent of the Mahayuti coalition government. This coalition also includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena faction led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. Sunetra Pawar, wife of Ajit Pawar, recently secured a seat in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's Parliament, marking her entry into central legislative politics earlier this month. Her elevation to the Deputy Chief Minister position in the state, if confirmed, would represent a substantial expansion of her political responsibilities and influence.

Chhagan Bhujbal, a prominent figure within the Ajit Pawar faction of the NCP and a minister in the current state cabinet, made the declaration, underscoring the party's internal decisions regarding leadership and government representation. The move is viewed by political observers as a strategic step to further strengthen the Ajit Pawar faction's presence and leverage within the state administration, especially given the ongoing complexities of intra-party dynamics within the broader NCP.

The role of Deputy Chief Minister is a critical executive position, involving significant responsibilities in state governance and policy implementation. Maharashtra currently has two Deputy Chief Ministers: Devendra Fadnavis from the BJP and Ajit Pawar from the NCP. The addition of Sunetra Pawar would make her the third Deputy Chief Minister, a configuration that reflects the intricate power-sharing arrangements within the ruling Mahayuti alliance. Her appointment would likely entail specific portfolios and administrative duties, contributing to the state's governance framework.

Key aspects of this development include:
*   **Announcement Source:** The information was conveyed by senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal, a minister in the current Maharashtra cabinet.
*   **Political Context:** Sunetra Pawar is the wife of current Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.
*   **Recent Political Entry:** She was recently elected to the Rajya Sabha, India's upper house of Parliament.
*   **Government Coalition:** The NCP faction (led by Ajit Pawar) is part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance in Maharashtra, alongside the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction).
*   **Significance of Role:** The Deputy Chief Minister position carries considerable administrative and political weight within the state government.

The formal announcement regarding Sunetra Pawar's leadership role within the NCP faction and her oath-taking ceremony as Deputy Chief Minister is expected to occur as indicated by Bhujbal's statement. This development is anticipated to draw close scrutiny from political analysts and the public, as it reshapes internal party leadership and the executive structure of Maharashtra's state government. Future statements from the NCP and the Chief Minister's Office will provide further details on the allocation of portfolios and the official commencement of her tenure.
