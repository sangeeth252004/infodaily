Varanasi-based seer Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati has escalated a dispute surrounding the upcoming Magh Mela in Prayagraj, issuing two major demands and directly challenging Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The seer called upon the Chief Minister to fulfill these demands as proof of his status as a "Hindu sympathiser" ahead of the annual religious congregation scheduled for January 2023.

The demands were articulated by Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati from Varanasi, placing increased scrutiny on the state government's approach to religious leadership and events. His statement has reignited discussions within religious and political circles regarding the expectations of spiritual leaders from the ruling administration.

Key demands presented by Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati include:

*   **Installation of a statue of Shankaracharya:** The seer has demanded that a statue of Adi Shankaracharya be installed within the Magh Mela area in Prayagraj. This demand seeks to visually establish a prominent symbol of Hindu spiritual tradition at the significant pilgrimage site.
*   **Declaration of India as a 'Hindu Rashtra':** A broader and more politically charged demand is for the formal declaration of India as a 'Hindu Rashtra' (Hindu Nation). This call resonates with a segment of Hindu nationalist sentiment and would entail significant constitutional and societal implications if pursued.

Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati indicated that the fulfillment of these demands would be a crucial test for Chief Minister Adityanath, a prominent figure in Hindu nationalist politics and a Mahant (head priest) of the Gorakhnath Math. The seer's challenge suggests an underlying expectation for the Chief Minister to actively champion specific Hindu causes and agenda items.

This development follows earlier reports of Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati's intentions to perform 'kalpwas' – a month-long religious observance – during the Magh Mela. He had also previously proposed organizing a 'dharma sansad' (religious parliament) during the Mela to deliberate on various religious issues. Prior to these demands, the seer had expressed concerns regarding the alleged lack of clearing of an area designated for his camp at the Magh Mela site.

While Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati's "coronation" as the Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth was recently set aside by the Allahabad High Court, he maintains that the legal battle over the succession continues. Despite the ongoing legal process, he continues to assert his spiritual authority and voice concerns on behalf of devotees. The seer emphasized that followers of Sanatan Dharma widely aspire to see India recognized as a Hindu Rashtra, framing his demands as reflective of broader sentiment within the religious community.

The Uttar Pradesh government and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have not yet issued a formal response to these specific demands. The situation is expected to evolve as the Magh Mela draws closer, with religious and political stakeholders closely observing any further statements or actions from either side. The demands are likely to remain a focal point in discussions concerning religious freedom, state-religion relations, and cultural identity in the region.
