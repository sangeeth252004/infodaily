NEW DELHI – As preliminary consultations for the Union Budget 2026 commence, various industry associations, taxpayer advocacy groups, and economic analysts are articulating a set of key income tax expectations aimed at providing relief and incentivizing savings for salaried individuals and the middle-class segment. These representations are being submitted to the Ministry of Finance, outlining adjustments sought across several critical tax provisions.

The focus of these expectations largely centers on measures to counter inflationary pressures, stimulate consumption, and encourage long-term financial planning. Taxpayer bodies emphasize the need for fiscal policies that reflect current economic realities and support a significant portion of the workforce. The government typically initiates pre-budget dialogues with various stakeholders, including economists, business leaders, and public representatives, to gather insights and recommendations before finalizing the budget proposals.

Among the prominent demands being put forth, five key areas of income tax adjustments are frequently highlighted by those representing salaried and middle-class taxpayers:

*   **Revision of Income Tax Slabs:** A primary expectation is the upward revision of income tax slabs, particularly an increase in the basic exemption limit. Current calls suggest raising the threshold from the existing levels, potentially to ₹5 lakh under the old tax regime, to provide more disposable income to lower and middle-income groups. Proponents argue this adjustment is overdue, considering sustained inflation over the past several years, which erodes purchasing power.
*   **Increase in Standard Deduction:** Taxpayers are advocating for an enhancement of the standard deduction for salaried employees, currently capped at ₹50,000. Representations propose an increase to at least ₹75,000 or ₹1 lakh, citing rising costs associated with employment, such as commuting, professional development, and work-from-home expenses, which have become more prevalent.
*   **Enhanced Section 80C Limit:** There is a significant demand to increase the limit under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, which allows deductions for various investments and expenses, currently set at ₹1.5 lakh. This limit has remained unchanged for nearly a decade, despite inflation and increased costs of living and investing. Projections suggest an increase to ₹2.5 lakh or ₹3 lakh would incentivize greater long-term savings in instruments like Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund, life insurance premiums, and home loan principal repayments.
*   **Higher Deduction for Housing Loan Interest:** For homeowners, especially in urban centers, the current limit of ₹2 lakh on deduction for interest paid on housing loans for self-occupied property under Section 24(b) is considered insufficient. Advocacy groups recommend raising this limit to ₹3 lakh or ₹3.5 lakh, reflecting the substantial increase in property prices and borrowing costs across major Indian cities over recent years. This change would provide relief to a large section of the middle class investing in housing.
*   **Dedicated Deductions for Health and Education Expenses:** While Section 80D allows deductions for health insurance premiums, there is a push for higher limits or a separate, dedicated deduction for general medical expenses, not covered by insurance. Similarly, calls are being made for independent deductions for children's education expenses, separate from the broader Section 80C, to ease the financial burden on families investing in quality education.

These proposals collectively aim to inject greater liquidity into the hands of the salaried and middle-class segments, potentially boosting consumption and savings, which are critical for economic growth. The Ministry of Finance will carefully consider these representations alongside other economic factors and fiscal constraints as it formulates the Union Budget 2026. The final decisions on these income tax measures are expected to be unveiled by the Finance Minister during the budget presentation, typically held in February of the budget year.
