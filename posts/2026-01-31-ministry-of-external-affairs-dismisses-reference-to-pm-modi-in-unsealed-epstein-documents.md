India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has issued a robust dismissal of references to Prime Minister Narendra Modi found within recently unsealed court documents pertaining to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The MEA spokesperson, upon queries from the press, categorized the mentions as "trashy ruminations of a convicted criminal," unequivocally rejecting their credibility.

The statement by the MEA addresses a reference circulating following the public release of documents by a U.S. court. These files are part of a defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former associate, and include depositions and testimonies that name numerous individuals. Among these references was an unsubstantiated mention linked to Prime Minister Modi's 2017 official visit to Israel.

The Ministry underscored that such indirect or unsubstantiated mentions originating from legal proceedings involving a convicted individual like Epstein hold no factual basis or significance. The spokesperson emphasized that the government views the allegations, particularly those involving high-profile public figures, with extreme skepticism when they emerge from such tainted sources.

Key details surrounding the situation include:
*   **Origin of Reference:** The mention appeared within a tranche of documents recently unsealed by a U.S. federal court. These documents are a component of a civil lawsuit.
*   **Nature of Files:** The unsealed files contain depositions, affidavits, and exhibits from a 2015 defamation lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell.
*   **Specific Mention:** While the exact context within the voluminous documents remains subject to public scrutiny, the MEA's response specifically targets a reference related to Prime Minister Modi's state visit to Israel in 2017.
*   **MEA's Stance:** The Ministry's characterization of the reference as "trashy ruminations" highlights its official position to disregard and discredit any such allusions.

The MEA's swift and direct response aims to clarify the official Indian position on the matter and to preempt any potential misinterpretations or unwarranted speculation arising from the broad release of the Epstein documents. This diplomatic move is consistent with the government's approach to vigorously challenge claims that it deems baseless, particularly those with the potential to tarnish the reputation of its leadership or the nation.

The wider implications of the Epstein documents continue to unfold globally, with various individuals and entities mentioned within the files facing scrutiny. For India, the MEA's statement serves as a definitive closure on the government's part regarding this specific reference, indicating that no further credibility or attention will be afforded to it. The government has not indicated any further action beyond this official dismissal.
