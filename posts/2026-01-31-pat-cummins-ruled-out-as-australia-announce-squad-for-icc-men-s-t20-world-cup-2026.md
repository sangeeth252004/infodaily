MELBOURNE, Australia – Cricket Australia (CA) today confirmed that star all-rounder Pat Cummins will miss the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 due to a significant injury, simultaneously announcing its 15-member squad for the tournament. The highly anticipated squad was revealed from CA headquarters in Melbourne, outlining the team that will compete in the global event scheduled for June and July 2026.

Cummins' absence represents a substantial blow to the Australian campaign. The 32-year-old sustained a lower back stress fracture during the recent bilateral series against India and has been advised a recovery period of at least five months. Medical reports indicate that while the injury is not career-threatening, his participation in the intensive T20 format, particularly as a key bowler and leader, would pose an undue risk of re-injury. Cummins has been a pivotal figure for Australia across all formats, contributing with both pace and crucial late-order runs, and his leadership has been instrumental in previous World Cup successes.

In light of Cummins' unavailability, all-rounder Mitchell Marsh has been appointed captain for the tournament. Marsh, 34, has previously led Australia in T20 Internationals and brings extensive experience to the role. The squad, selected by a panel comprising George Bailey, Tony Dodemaide, and head coach Andrew McDonald, features a blend of seasoned veterans and emerging talent, aiming for a strong performance on the world stage.

Key details of the announced squad include:

*   **Captain:** Mitchell Marsh
*   **Wicketkeepers:** Alex Carey, Josh Inglis
*   **Batsmen:** David Warner, Travis Head, Steve Smith, Tim David
*   **All-rounders:** Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Cameron Green
*   **Fast Bowlers:** Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Ellis, Spencer Johnson
*   **Spin Bowlers:** Adam Zampa, Matthew Short

The selection panel has prioritized versatility and depth, particularly in the bowling department, to adapt to varying conditions throughout the tournament. The inclusion of young pacers like Spencer Johnson alongside seasoned campaigners Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood aims to provide a robust fast-bowling attack. Matthew Short's all-round capabilities and Adam Zampa's leg-spin will be crucial in the middle overs. The batting lineup remains formidable, featuring explosive openers and experienced middle-order hitters.

The Australian team is scheduled to participate in a series of warm-up matches in the months leading up to the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026. These preparatory fixtures will allow the squad to fine-tune their strategies and combinations under the leadership of Mitchell Marsh. The tournament itself is set to commence in early June 2026, with Australia's full fixture list expected to be released by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in the coming weeks. The team will convene for a training camp in late May 2026 before departing for the host nation.
