NEW DELHI – The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on December 20, 2025, officially released the admit cards for the Engineering Services Examination (ESE) 2026 Preliminary stage. Candidates who have successfully applied for the examination can now download their admit cards directly from the UPSC's official website, upsc.gov.in. The preliminary examination is scheduled to be conducted nationwide on January 21, 2026.

The ESE is a highly competitive examination for engineering graduates seeking to join prestigious Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ services under the Government of India. These services span various departments and ministries, including the Indian Railway Service, Central Engineering Service, Border Roads Engineering Service, and other specialized engineering roles across Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Electronics & Telecommunication disciplines. This year, approximately 450 vacancies are expected to be filled through the ESE 2026 cycle.

The Preliminary Examination serves as the first stage of a multi-tiered selection process, which also includes a Main Examination and a Personality Test. The Prelims consist of two objective-type papers: Paper-I (General Studies and Engineering Aptitude) and Paper-II (Engineering Discipline specific). Paper-I carries a maximum of 200 marks with a duration of two hours, while Paper-II is discipline-specific, carrying 300 marks and lasting three hours. Both papers feature negative marking for incorrect answers.

To download their admit cards, candidates are required to log in to the UPSC portal using their registration ID or roll number along with their date of birth. It is mandatory for all candidates to carry a printed copy of their admit card to the examination venue. The admit card contains critical information such as the candidate's name, roll number, examination center details, photograph, and signature. Candidates are advised to carefully review all particulars mentioned on the admit card and report any discrepancies to the UPSC authorities immediately.

Key guidelines for the examination day include:

*   **Mandatory Photo ID:** Candidates must carry a valid photo identity proof, such as an Aadhaar Card, Passport, Driving License, Voter ID, or any other government-issued ID, in original, along with the admit card.
*   **Reporting Time:** Candidates are advised to reach the examination venue well in advance of the reporting time to complete necessary formalities. Gates will close at a specified time, and no candidate will be allowed entry thereafter.
*   **Prohibited Items:** Electronic gadgets, including mobile phones, smartwatches, calculators (unless specified for a particular paper), Bluetooth devices, and any other communication devices, are strictly prohibited inside the examination hall.
*   **Writing Instrument:** Candidates must use only a black ballpoint pen for marking responses on the OMR answer sheets.
*   **Adherence to Instructions:** All candidates are required to strictly follow the instructions provided by the invigilators and adhere to the examination's code of conduct.

Candidates facing technical issues while downloading the admit card or identifying discrepancies in their details are advised to contact the UPSC facilitation counter via telephone or email during working hours.

With the admit cards now accessible, qualified candidates are urged to intensify their preparation for the upcoming preliminary examination. Successful candidates from this stage will subsequently be eligible to appear for the ESE 2026 Main Examination, dates for which will be announced by the Commission in due course.
