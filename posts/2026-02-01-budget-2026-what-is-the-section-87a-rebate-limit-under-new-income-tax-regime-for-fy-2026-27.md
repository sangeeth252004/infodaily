As individual taxpayers in India plan for future financial years, understanding the current income tax provisions, particularly those concerning rebates, remains crucial. For Financial Year 2026-27, the Section 87A income tax rebate under the new tax regime is governed by amendments introduced in the Union Budget 2023. These provisions currently exempt resident individuals opting for the new regime from income tax liability up to a specific threshold.

The Union Budget 2023 significantly restructured the new income tax regime, making it the default option for taxpayers unless they explicitly choose the old regime. A key amendment was the enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, which directly impacts the net tax payable by eligible resident individuals. Under the revised norms, taxpayers whose total taxable income does not exceed ₹7 lakh are eligible for a full tax rebate, effectively resulting in zero tax liability. This provision applies to all eligible individuals opting for the new regime from Financial Year 2023-24 onwards, and consequently, without further legislative changes, would extend to Financial Year 2026-27.

The Section 87A rebate is designed to reduce the tax burden on middle-income groups. Prior to the Budget 2023 changes, the rebate under the new regime was applicable for incomes up to ₹5 lakh. The increase in this threshold to ₹7 lakh represents a substantial benefit for a large segment of the salaried and self-employed population. If a taxpayer's income slightly exceeds ₹7 lakh but remains below ₹7.27 lakh, the rebate is structured to ensure that the tax payable does not exceed the difference between their total income and ₹7 lakh. This marginal relief mechanism prevents a sudden jump in tax liability for those just above the ₹7 lakh threshold.

Key details regarding the Section 87A rebate under the new income tax regime for FY 2026-27, based on current legislation, include:

*   **Eligibility:** The rebate is available exclusively to resident individuals who opt for the new income tax regime. Non-resident individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) are not eligible.
*   **Income Threshold:** A full rebate is granted when the total taxable income does not exceed ₹7 lakh.
*   **Rebate Amount:** The maximum rebate available under Section 87A is ₹25,000. This amount effectively neutralizes the tax liability for incomes up to ₹7 lakh, as the tax calculated on ₹7 lakh under the new regime is ₹25,000.
*   **Marginal Relief:** For taxable incomes marginally exceeding ₹7 lakh (up to approximately ₹7.27 lakh), the tax payable is limited to the difference between the total income and ₹7 lakh, provided this amount is less than the calculated tax.

The new income tax regime, introduced initially in Budget 2020 and made more attractive in Budget 2023, is characterized by lower tax rates across various slabs but requires foregoing several common deductions and exemptions available under the old regime. This includes popular deductions like those under Section 80C (for investments such as PPF, ELSS, life insurance premiums), Section 80D (health insurance premiums), House Rent Allowance (HRA), and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA). The Section 87A rebate is one of the few benefits retained and enhanced within this simplified tax structure.

As Budget 2026 approaches, these provisions are the standing framework for the Section 87A rebate within the new income tax regime. Any future modifications to these limits or the regime itself would require legislative amendments during the tabling of subsequent Union Budgets. For the present, individual taxpayers planning for FY 2026-27 can rely on the existing provisions that provide significant tax relief for incomes up to ₹7 lakh under the new tax framework.
