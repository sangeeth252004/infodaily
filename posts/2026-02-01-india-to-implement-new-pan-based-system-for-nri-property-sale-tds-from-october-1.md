In a significant change poised to streamline tax compliance for property transactions involving Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), India's tax authorities have announced the implementation of a new Permanent Account Number (PAN)-based challan system for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). This revised mechanism, replacing the current Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number (TAN)-based system, is set to take effect from October 1. The initiative is being introduced in the context of ongoing fiscal reforms and discussions leading up to the fiscal year 2025-2026, often referred to as Budget 2026.

The primary objective of this shift is to simplify the process for resident buyers who are required to deduct tax at source when purchasing immovable property from an NRI seller. Under the previous regime, buyers were mandated to obtain a TAN, a separate 10-digit alphanumeric number, solely for the purpose of deducting and remitting TDS on such transactions. This often led to additional administrative burdens and compliance complexities, particularly for individuals who were not regular tax deductors.

The new system will leverage the buyer's existing PAN for all TDS-related challan payments. This means individuals purchasing property from an NRI will no longer need to apply for or possess a TAN. Instead, they will use their own PAN to generate the challan, deposit the TDS, and file the necessary statements with the income tax department. This change is expected to significantly ease the procedural requirements, making property transactions involving NRIs more accessible and less cumbersome for resident buyers. The simplification is anticipated to encourage greater compliance and reduce instances of inadvertent non-compliance stemming from the complexities of the TAN acquisition and usage process.

Key details of the new system include:
*   **Replacement of TAN:** The requirement for buyers to obtain a TAN for deducting TDS on NRI property sales is eliminated.
*   **PAN-based Challan:** Buyers will now use their own Permanent Account Number (PAN) for all TDS deposits.
*   **Effective Date:** The new system comes into force from October 1.
*   **Targeted Transactions:** Applicable specifically to the sale of immovable property by Non-Resident Indians.
*   **Simplified Compliance:** Aims to reduce the administrative burden on individual buyers.

The move underscores the government's broader strategy to enhance ease of doing business and improve the efficiency of tax administration through digitisation and simplification of procedures. By integrating the TDS process for NRI property sales into the more widely used PAN framework, authorities aim to create a more user-friendly environment for taxpayers. Stakeholders, including property buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and financial consultants, are advised to familiarise themselves with the updated regulations to ensure seamless adherence to the new tax compliance framework once it becomes operational. The long-term implications are expected to include improved data matching, reduced errors, and a more transparent system for tracking property-related tax deductions.
