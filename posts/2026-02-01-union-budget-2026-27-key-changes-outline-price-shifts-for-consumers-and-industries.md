NEW DELHI – Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2026, presented the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2026-27, outlining significant adjustments to customs and excise duties. These proposals are set to influence the cost of a wide array of goods and services, directly affecting consumer spending and various industrial sectors across the nation. The budget's focus appears to be on boosting domestic manufacturing, promoting health, and fiscal prudence.

The budget proposals aim to enhance the 'Make in India' initiative, streamline supply chains, and rationalize tax structures to foster economic growth. This includes strategic changes designed to make certain essential goods and domestically manufactured products more affordable, while simultaneously increasing the cost of specific luxury items and products deemed detrimental to public health.

**Items Expected to Become Cheaper:**

*   **Smartphones:** The government has proposed a rationalization of customs duties on certain sub-components used in smartphone manufacturing. This move, aimed at strengthening the domestic electronics manufacturing ecosystem under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, is expected to reduce the final retail prices of locally assembled smartphones by up to 2.5-3%.
*   **Microwave Ovens:** Similar to smartphones, duty adjustments on specific parts and raw materials for microwave ovens manufactured in India are anticipated to lead to a decrease in their market prices, promoting local production.
*   **Cancer Medicines:** Basic customs duty exemptions have been expanded for a broader range of life-saving cancer drugs. This measure aims to make critical medication more accessible and affordable for patients, particularly benefiting public health initiatives.
*   **Leather Goods:** To boost the leather industry's export potential and domestic value addition, import duties on specific machinery and raw hides for leather processing have been reduced by 5%. This is projected to lower manufacturing costs for finished leather products.
*   **Seafood Products:** Customs duties on certain inputs for seafood processing and aquaculture have been eased, which could lead to more competitive pricing for domestically processed seafood and support the blue economy.
*   **Sports Equipment:** Duties on certain components and raw materials used in the domestic manufacturing of sports goods have been cut, potentially making a range of sporting equipment more affordable for consumers and encouraging sports participation.

**Items Expected to Become Costlier:**

*   **Alcoholic Beverages:** Excise duties on a range of alcoholic beverages, particularly imported spirits, have been increased by approximately 10-15%. This hike is expected to translate into higher retail prices, contributing to government revenue.
*   **Tobacco Products:** Following a consistent trend, the Union Budget 2026-27 proposes a significant increase in excise duty and the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) across various tobacco products, including cigarettes, bidis, and chewing tobacco. This measure, aimed at discouraging consumption for public health reasons, is projected to raise prices by 15-20%.
*   **Luxury Imported Goods:** To curb non-essential imports and promote domestic alternatives, basic customs duties on select luxury imported items, including high-end electronics not manufactured domestically and certain automotive components, have seen an increase of up to 5%.

The Ministry of Finance stated that these tariff adjustments are carefully calibrated to support economic growth, create employment opportunities through domestic manufacturing, and ensure fiscal stability. While consumers may see immediate price shifts, the long-term implications are tied to the broader goals of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) and sustainable economic development. The budget proposals will now undergo parliamentary debate and approval before full implementation takes effect.
