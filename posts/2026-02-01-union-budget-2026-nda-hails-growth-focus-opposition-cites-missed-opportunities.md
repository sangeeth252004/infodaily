New Delhi, India – The Union Budget 2026, presented by the Finance Minister in Parliament on February 1, 2026, has elicited sharply divided responses from the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) parties and the opposition bloc. While NDA leaders lauded the fiscal plan as visionary and growth-oriented, opposition parties criticized it for allegedly falling short on crucial economic and social fronts.

The Finance Minister, in a statement following the presentation, highlighted the budget's focus on infrastructure development, job creation, and fiscal prudence. Senior NDA members echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the budget's potential to drive India's economic growth over the coming year. They pointed to strategic allocations aimed at boosting manufacturing, digital transformation, and green energy initiatives as key strengths. The Prime Minister described the budget as a "blueprint for a prosperous India," designed to empower various sections of society and foster a resilient economy.

*   **Key points of support from NDA:**
    *   Increased capital expenditure for infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, and urban development.
    *   Incentives for domestic manufacturing and technology adoption to enhance global competitiveness.
    *   Measures aimed at fiscal consolidation, targeting a sustainable reduction in the fiscal deficit.
    *   Support for agriculture and rural development through targeted schemes and credit access.
    *   Focus on youth skill development and entrepreneurship initiatives.

Conversely, opposition parties expressed strong reservations about the budget's provisions and overall direction. Leaders from various opposition parties converged on criticisms ranging from insufficient measures for poverty alleviation and employment generation to a perceived lack of relief for middle-income households. They argued that the budget did not adequately address issues such as rising inflation and income inequality. The Leader of the Opposition described the budget as "disappointing and out of touch with the common person's reality," asserting that it favored specific sectors over broad-based welfare.

*   **Primary criticisms from Opposition:**
    *   Alleged inadequacy of direct relief measures for common citizens and salaried classes.
    *   Concerns over the actual impact on job creation, particularly in the informal sector.
    *   Claimed insufficient allocations for critical social sectors like healthcare and education, despite some increases.
    *   Criticism regarding the effectiveness of policies to control inflation and commodity prices.
    *   Accusations of widening economic disparities by concentrating benefits in select areas.

Following the budget's presentation, a period of intensive parliamentary debate is scheduled to commence. Members of both houses will analyze the proposals in detail, raising questions and offering amendments. The government is expected to defend its budgetary choices, citing long-term economic benefits and strategic national objectives. The reactions indicate a robust legislative process ahead, as stakeholders scrutinize the financial roadmap laid out for the fiscal year 2026-27. Economists and industry experts are now evaluating the budget's projected impact on various sectors and the broader economy, with their initial assessments expected in the coming days. The implementation phase will be crucial in determining whether the budget achieves its stated objectives amid evolving domestic and global economic conditions.
