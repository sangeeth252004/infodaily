Reports emerged in early October 2022 regarding significant insurgent activity in Pakistan's Balochistan province. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), through its Majeed Brigade, claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated attacks, dubbed "Operation Herof," targeting Pakistani security forces in multiple locations, including the districts of Panjgur and Nushki. The BLA stated these operations resulted in 145 Pakistani security personnel killed and several others captured alive. Conversely, Pakistani military authorities reported a considerably lower number of casualties for their forces, while claiming to have killed a larger number of insurgents.

On October 7, 2022, the BLA issued a statement via its spokesperson, Jeeyand Baloch, detailing "Operation Herof." The BLA asserted that its "fidayeen" (suicide attackers) from the Majeed Brigade initiated these attacks "on Wednesday morning" and concluded them "on Friday night." Targets included headquarters, camps, and intelligence offices of Pakistani Frontier Corps and army personnel in Panjgur and Nushki. The group claimed its fighters maintained control of these facilities for up to 60 hours in some instances. Beyond Panjgur and Nushki, the BLA also reported engaging a military camp in Sibi, a paramilitary check post in Bolan, and conducting a raid in Kech. The BLA released images and videos purportedly showing its fighters inside Pakistani security compounds and displaying captured weapons. BLA leader Bashir Zeb was cited in the statement, reaffirming the group's objective to end what it termed the "occupation of Balochistan by Pakistan."

Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the armed forces, confirmed attacks in Panjgur and Nushki. ISPR's statements, however, presented a different account of the casualties. It reported that security forces "repulsed" the attacks, killing 13 "terrorists" and losing seven security personnel, who were identified as martyrs. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attacks, while then-Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed stated that 4-5 "terrorists" were killed in Panjgur and nine in Nushki. The significant discrepancy in casualty figures between the BLA's claims and official Pakistani reports underscored the contested nature of the events.

The BLA, an organization advocating for an independent Balochistan, has historically engaged in armed conflict with Pakistani state forces. The Majeed Brigade, specifically, is known for its high-profile and often suicidal attacks. Balochistan, rich in natural resources, is strategically important due to its proximity to vital shipping lanes and its role in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The BLA has previously targeted Chinese nationals and interests in the region, viewing CPEC projects as exploitative and contributing to Pakistan's "occupation" of Balochistan. Following the incidents, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry summoned the Indian Charge d'Affaires, alleging India's involvement in supporting such "terrorist activities" in Balochistan. India has consistently denied such allegations.

The events of early October 2022 highlighted the ongoing security challenges in Balochistan and the persistent insurgent activity in the region. The conflicting reports from the BLA and Pakistani authorities underscored the complexity of the conflict and the difficulty in independently verifying claims amidst an active insurgency. The situation continues to be a focal point for regional security concerns.
