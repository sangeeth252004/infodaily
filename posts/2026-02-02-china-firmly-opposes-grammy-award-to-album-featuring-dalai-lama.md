BEIJING – China's Foreign Ministry has issued a strong statement opposing the recent Grammy Award for "Best New Age Album" to "Inner World," an album that features spiritual narrations by the Dalai Lama. The official stance, articulated by Spokesperson Zhao Lijian, reiterates China's long-standing position that the Dalai Lama is a political exile engaged in separatist activities rather than a purely religious figure.

The opposition follows the 64th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, held on April 3, 2022, in Las Vegas, where the album "Inner World" was recognized. The award was accepted by Indian music producer Ricky Kej and American musician Stewart Copeland, known for his work with The Police. The album's content includes the Dalai Lama's recitations, described as spiritual narrations aimed at promoting peace and compassion.

During a press briefing in Beijing, Mr. Zhao stated, "The so-called Dalai Lama is not a religious person, but a political exile who has been engaged in anti-China separatist activities for a long time under the cloak of religion." This statement underscores Beijing's consistent view of the Dalai Lama as a figure undermining China's sovereignty over Tibet. China has maintained that the Tibetan spiritual leader is attempting to split the region from China, a claim the Dalai Lama denies, stating he seeks only genuine autonomy for Tibet.

Key details regarding the Grammy recognition and China's response include:
*   **Award Category:** "Best New Age Album"
*   **Winning Album:** "Inner World"
*   **Key Artists:** Indian music producer Ricky Kej and American musician Stewart Copeland.
*   **Dalai Lama's Role:** Provided spiritual narrations and teachings for the album.
*   **Grammy Ceremony:** 64th Annual Grammy Awards, April 3, 2022, Las Vegas.
*   **China's Spokesperson:** Zhao Lijian, Foreign Ministry.
*   **China's Stance:** Views the award as an endorsement of a "political exile" engaged in "anti-China separatist activities."

The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet to India in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has consistently been a point of contention in international relations involving China. Beijing has historically voiced objections to any official or prominent recognition of the Dalai Lama by foreign governments, international organizations, or cultural institutions, viewing such actions as interference in China's internal affairs. Previous instances include China’s disapproval of various awards and diplomatic engagements involving the Tibetan spiritual leader.

The Grammy award for "Inner World" and China's subsequent firm opposition highlight the ongoing diplomatic complexities surrounding the Dalai Lama's international profile. While the album is available on global streaming platforms, the incident reinforces the geopolitical sensitivities associated with recognizing figures considered problematic by the Chinese government, often leading to diplomatic protests and potential broader implications for cultural and political exchanges. As of the time of this report, there has been no official statement from the Recording Academy regarding China's opposition.
