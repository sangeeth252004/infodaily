The Election Commission of India (ECI) has issued a strong rebuttal to allegations made by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, detailing what it described as "misbehavior" during a meeting with a Special Observer. The ECI's statement outlined that Ms. Banerjee "misbehaved, thumped the table, and left" the interaction, which reportedly focused on a Specific Incident Report (SIR) related to the Nandigram constituency during the 2021 West Bengal assembly elections.

The incident in question reportedly took place on April 1, 2021, involving Ms. Banerjee and Special Observer Ajay V. Nayak. Following the meeting, Ms. Banerjee publicly criticized Mr. Nayak, accusing him of bias and using "unparliamentary" language. She questioned his impartiality, alleging a background as a former BJP leader. Election officials later clarified that Mr. Nayak is a retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer whose role was strictly non-partisan oversight.

In its counter-statement, the ECI asserted that the meeting was convened to address the Specific Incident Report concerning an event in Nandigram, a politically significant constituency where Ms. Banerjee was a candidate. The Commission's account described Ms. Banerjee's conduct during the discussion as disruptive, culminating in her abrupt departure from the proceedings. This direct refutation by the ECI underscores the heightened tensions and scrutiny that often characterize high-stakes electoral processes in the region.

The role of Special Observers, such as Mr. Nayak, is integral to the ECI's efforts to ensure free and fair elections. These officials are tasked with monitoring various aspects of the election, including law and order, expenditure, and overall adherence to the Model Code of Conduct. The Specific Incident Report in this context served as a formal documentation of an event requiring the Commission's review and action.

Key details surrounding the situation include:
*   **Parties Involved:** Election Commission of India (ECI), West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Special Observer Ajay V. Nayak.
*   **Event Date:** The alleged incident between Ms. Banerjee and Mr. Nayak occurred on April 1, 2021.
*   **Location:** Nandigram constituency, West Bengal.
*   **Subject:** Specific Incident Report (SIR) concerning events during the 2021 West Bengal assembly elections.
*   **Allegations by Ms. Banerjee:** Bias, "unparliamentary" language by the Special Observer.
*   **ECI's Counter-allegation:** Ms. Banerjee "misbehaved, thumped the table, and left" the meeting.

The ECI's statement emphasized its commitment to protecting its officials from unwarranted attacks and upholding the integrity of the electoral machinery. It highlighted the importance of constructive and respectful dialogue between political stakeholders and election officials, particularly during sensitive periods like state assembly elections.

This public exchange between a prominent political leader and the national election body reflects the challenging environment faced by electoral authorities in maintaining neutrality and enforcing regulations. The incident further illustrates the intense political climate prevalent during high-stakes elections and the various forms of scrutiny applied to both candidates and election management bodies as the ECI continues its work across the country.
