Discussions regarding fiscal prudence and government asset management are expected to gain momentum as a recent assessment highlights that 308 state-level Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) are currently non-operational but have not been formally dissolved. This status, colloquially referred to as "dead, not buried," signifies a continued financial and administrative burden on state exchequers, a situation likely to feature in policy debates leading up to the Union Budget 2026 and subsequent state budgets. The findings underscore a persistent challenge in rationalizing government-owned enterprises across various states.

The identification of these defunct entities points to a significant allocation of public resources towards maintaining non-contributing assets. While the exact financial implications vary by state and the nature of each PSU, such enterprises often incur ongoing costs related to administrative overheads, pending liabilities, and the upkeep of underutilized or abandoned infrastructure. This situation hinders efficient capital allocation, diverts funds from essential public services, and contributes to overall fiscal stress at the state level. The presence of these dormant entities has been a subject of concern for government auditors and financial committees for an extended period, suggesting a systemic issue in the winding-up process of public sector bodies.

Key aspects of this situation include:
*   **Number:** A total of 308 state PSUs are identified as non-functional.
*   **Nature:** These are state-level undertakings, indicating that the responsibility for their resolution lies with individual state governments.
*   **Status:** They are no longer operational but continue to exist on official records, preventing the full realization of their assets or the closure of liabilities.
*   **Impact:** They contribute to inefficiencies in public expenditure and hold back potential revenue from asset monetization.

The Indian government has, in recent years, signaled a strong intent towards the rationalization of public sector entities, encompassing both central and state PSUs. Policies have focused on strategic disinvestment, privatization, and outright closure of loss-making or non-performing units to improve economic efficiency and reduce the government's presence in non-strategic sectors. The continued existence of 308 non-operational state PSUs suggests that these reform initiatives still face implementation hurdles at the state level.

Looking ahead, the status of these defunct PSUs is anticipated to be a critical agenda item in future fiscal planning and policy formulation. State governments may be encouraged to expedite processes for winding up these entities, liquidating assets, and settling outstanding liabilities. Such measures are crucial for freeing up capital, reducing wasteful expenditure, and demonstrating a commitment to fiscal discipline. The Union Budget 2026 and subsequent state budgets are expected to reflect ongoing efforts to streamline government operations and enhance the productivity of public assets.
