Jânio "Júnior" Pena, a Brazilian influencer known for his pro-Trump political commentary and online presence, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in late October 2022. Pena's detention garnered significant attention due to his public profile and past statements regarding immigration policies and deportation in the United States.

Pena had previously made public declarations asserting that only individuals involved in criminal activities faced deportation from the U.S. His detention by federal authorities has drawn public commentary, contrasting his prior statements with his current situation. As an influencer, Pena cultivated a following, particularly within Brazilian-American communities and among supporters of former President Donald Trump. His content often focused on political and social commentary relevant to these audiences.

The specifics of Pena's immigration status or the exact reasons leading to his detention by ICE were not immediately made public by the agency. Immigration detentions by ICE typically occur when an individual is suspected of violating U.S. immigration laws, which can range from overstaying a visa to entering the country without authorization. Pena's case quickly became a topic of discussion across social media platforms and in various news outlets, highlighting the complex and often scrutinized nature of immigration enforcement.
