Former U.S. President Donald Trump has outlined specific conditions that would underpin a potential trade agreement between the United States and India if he were to return to office. Among these stipulations, Mr. Trump indicated that India would need to cease all imports of Russian oil, alongside the implementation of a zero-tariff policy on goods traded between the two countries.

These proposed conditions underscore a potential shift in U.S. foreign and economic policy towards India. The demand regarding Russian oil addresses a significant geopolitical concern for Washington. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, India has substantially increased its purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, becoming a major buyer despite Western sanctions aimed at limiting Moscow's energy revenues. Data from various energy tracking firms indicated that India's imports of Russian oil surged by hundreds of percentage points in the period following the conflict, often at prices below the G7-imposed price cap of $60 per barrel. This has allowed India to secure energy supplies at a reduced cost, but has also drawn scrutiny from some Western allies.

The second condition, proposing zero tariffs, would represent a substantial overhaul of existing trade relations. Both the United States and India have historically maintained various tariffs on goods, which have been points of contention in previous trade negotiations. A complete elimination of tariffs could potentially boost bilateral trade volumes and reduce consumer costs, but would also necessitate significant adjustments for domestic industries in both nations. During his previous term, Mr. Trump often advocated for protectionist policies and utilized tariffs as a negotiating tool, making the "zero tariffs" proposal a notable departure for potential partners under his future administration.

Key aspects of the proposed conditions include:

*   **Cessation of Russian Oil Imports:** India's current energy strategy has leaned on discounted Russian crude, which helps meet its vast energy demands and manage inflation. A move away from Russian oil would require India to diversify its energy sources, potentially increasing costs and impacting its energy security strategy.
*   **Zero Tariffs:** This condition would dismantle existing trade barriers, aiming to foster unrestricted commerce. It could benefit sectors like technology, agriculture, and manufacturing, depending on the specific goods targeted for tariff elimination. Previous U.S.-India trade discussions have often stalled on issues such as market access for agricultural products and medical devices.

The former President's statements reflect a broader "America First" foreign policy stance, prioritizing U.S. economic interests and seeking alignment with its geopolitical objectives. While these conditions are speculative, pending a future presidential election, they signal potential policy directions that could significantly reshape one of the world's most critical bilateral relationships. Both nations would face considerable economic and geopolitical considerations in evaluating such a framework, highlighting the complexities inherent in future trade and strategic partnerships.
