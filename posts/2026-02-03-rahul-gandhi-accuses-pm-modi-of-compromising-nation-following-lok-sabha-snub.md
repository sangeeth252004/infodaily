On March 11, 2022, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a significant political accusation outside the Parliament House in New Delhi, alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had "compromised and sold our nation." Gandhi's remarks followed an incident in the Lok Sabha where he reported being denied permission by the Speaker to speak on the government's foreign policy, specifically concerning the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Mr. Gandhi’s accusation stemmed from his attempt to initiate a discussion within the Lok Sabha regarding India's stance and strategy concerning the geopolitical situation. He stated to the media that his request to address Parliament on a critical issue of national interest was not granted. According to Mr. Gandhi, he sought to highlight the long-term implications of the government's foreign policy decisions, claiming that the current approach was "destroying the future of our children." He expressed his intent to provide context and details of his concerns had he been allowed to speak inside the legislative chamber.

The parliamentary incident involved Mr. Gandhi attempting to raise his points when Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla reportedly did not permit him to do so. Following this, Mr. Gandhi addressed a press conference, where he reiterated his frustration over what he described as the government's unwillingness to engage in an open debate on a matter of significant national and international importance. He emphasized that the right to discuss crucial foreign policy issues is fundamental to democratic functioning.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi swiftly responded to Mr. Gandhi's allegations, refuting the claims made by the Congress leader. Minister Joshi stated that Mr. Gandhi was not specifically denied permission to speak, but rather that the Lok Sabha session had been adjourned at the time of his attempt to address the House. Mr. Joshi further clarified that Mr. Gandhi's previous remarks against the government had been expunged from the parliamentary records, implying that such actions are consistent with established parliamentary rules and procedures. The Minister underscored that discussions on foreign policy issues are typically scheduled through proper parliamentary channels and protocols, often after consultations by the Business Advisory Committee.

*   **Date of Incident:** March 11, 2022
*   **Location:** Outside Parliament House, New Delhi
*   **Key Figures:** Rahul Gandhi (Congress Leader), Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pralhad Joshi (Parliamentary Affairs Minister), Om Birla (Lok Sabha Speaker)
*   **Core Issue:** Allegations concerning India's foreign policy on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and denial of parliamentary debate.
*   **Government's Stance:** Rebuttal of denial, citing parliamentary adjournment and previous expunged remarks.

The exchange between the opposition and the ruling party highlights the ongoing political tensions surrounding India's strategic positioning on global matters. Mr. Gandhi's direct accusation against the Prime Minister marks an escalation in the opposition's criticism regarding the government's handling of international relations and its perceived lack of parliamentary engagement on such issues. The incident brings into focus ongoing debates about the role of parliamentary debate, the scope of opposition scrutiny, and the established procedures for discussing sensitive international matters within India's legislative framework.

As parliamentary proceedings continue, the issues of India's foreign policy and the transparency of government decisions on national security matters are expected to remain points of significant contention. Further political debates and discussions are anticipated both inside and outside Parliament, with the opposition likely to continue pressing for greater accountability and transparency from the government.
