Three sisters, identified as Parul, 21, and twins Pooja and Payal, both 18, died early Tuesday morning after falling from the ninth floor of an apartment building in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The incident occurred around 2 AM at the Gaur Global Tower in Ahinsa Khand-II, Indirapuram, leading to a police investigation into the circumstances surrounding their deaths. Authorities have since registered a case of abetment to suicide against the parents of the deceased.

According to police reports, a private security guard, Rajkumar, 30s, was on duty when he heard screams emanating from the building. Upon looking up, he reported witnessing a distressing scene: one sister appeared to be hanging from the balcony while the other two were attempting to pull her back to safety. Moments later, all three fell to their deaths. Rajkumar immediately alerted emergency services and local police.

Upon arrival, law enforcement officials discovered the bodies of the three women. Autopsies were subsequently conducted as part of the standard investigative procedure. Initial police findings suggest that a prolonged family dispute may have been a contributing factor to the tragic event.

Key details from the ongoing investigation include:
*   The father of the sisters, Ishwar Singh, 45, a property dealer, was arrested by police for questioning.
*   The mother, Suman, 40, was also taken into custody for interrogation.
*   An FIR (First Information Report) has been registered under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (abetment to suicide) against both parents.
*   Neighbors residing in the Gaur Global Tower apartment complex reported hearing frequent altercations and arguments originating from the family's flat.
*   Police are examining potential financial difficulties and alleged dowry-related issues within the family as part of their inquiry. An uncle of the deceased reportedly informed investigators that Ishwar Singh had incurred significant debts, placing the family under considerable financial strain.
*   The family had recently moved into the rented flat approximately ten days prior to the incident.

The investigation is ongoing, with police officials gathering further evidence and statements from family members, neighbors, and other potential witnesses to ascertain the full sequence of events and the precise reasons that led to the deaths of the three sisters. Further details are expected to emerge as the inquiry progresses.
