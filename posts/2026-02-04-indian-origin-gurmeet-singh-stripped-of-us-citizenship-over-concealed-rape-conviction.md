A federal court in the District of New Jersey has ordered the denaturalization of Gurmeet Singh, an Indian-origin individual, for concealing a prior rape conviction during his application for U.S. citizenship. The order, signed on October 27, 2022, by U.S. District Judge Zahid N. Quraishi, effectively revokes Singh’s American citizenship, which he obtained in 2013 by providing false information under oath to immigration authorities.

Gurmeet Singh was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault in Cook County, Illinois, in July 2005. Following his conviction, he was sentenced to six years in prison. After completing his sentence, Singh was deported from the United States to India in 2010.

Despite his deportation, Singh subsequently re-entered the U.S. in 2011. In 2012, he applied for naturalization, initiating the process to become a U.S. citizen. During his naturalization interview in 2013, Singh swore under oath that he had never been arrested, cited, or detained by any law enforcement officer, and had never committed a crime for which he had not been arrested. These statements directly contradicted his 2005 conviction and imprisonment for aggravated criminal sexual assault. Based on these misrepresentations, Singh was granted U.S. citizenship in 2013.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated civil denaturalization proceedings against Singh in March 2022. The complaint alleged that Singh's citizenship was procured illegally because he intentionally concealed material facts and made false statements during his naturalization process, thereby committing immigration fraud. The recent court order affirms the DOJ's allegations, finding that Singh's citizenship was unlawfully obtained.

This denaturalization action underscores the commitment of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey and the Department of Justice to upholding the integrity of the nation's immigration system.

*   **Key Authorities Involved:** The denaturalization was announced by U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Philip R. Sellinger, and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton.
*   **Legal Basis:** The case demonstrated that Singh's naturalization was granted based on false sworn statements, which is grounds for revocation of citizenship under federal law.
*   **Broader Context:** The Department of Justice has stated its commitment to protecting the integrity of the U.S. immigration system through various initiatives aimed at identifying individuals who may have obtained naturalization improperly.

The revocation of Gurmeet Singh's citizenship means he no longer holds the rights and privileges associated with being a U.S. citizen. The immediate next steps for Singh regarding his immigration status were not detailed in the announcement, but denaturalization typically leads to proceedings for removal from the United States.
