Indian Railways has unveiled plans to introduce 260 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets, a significant step in the ongoing modernisation of the country's extensive rail network. The initiative aims to enhance long-distance passenger travel by providing advanced comfort and safety features, with a phased rollout anticipated across various routes. This development marks an expansion of the Vande Bharat series, which currently primarily operates as chair car services.

The introduction of sleeper variants addresses a critical need for modern, comfortable, and efficient long-haul rail travel, catering to overnight journeys. The new rakes are expected to gradually replace or supplement existing long-distance trains, offering a premium travel experience comparable to global standards. This strategic move aligns with the Ministry of Railways' broader vision to upgrade infrastructure and rolling stock, contributing to improved punctuality, safety, and overall passenger satisfaction. The project underscores a commitment to domestic manufacturing, leveraging the 'Make in India' initiative for production.

Key details of the planned Vande Bharat sleeper rakes include:

*   **Quantity:** A total of 260 sleeper rakes are planned for introduction.
*   **Design:** The sleeper trains will feature an upgraded interior design focused on enhanced passenger comfort, including improved berth designs, better ergonomics, and modern amenities suitable for overnight journeys.
*   **Safety Features:** These trains are expected to incorporate advanced safety systems such as the indigenously developed KAVACH Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, which helps prevent collisions by automatically applying brakes if a driver fails to react. Additionally, advanced fire detection and suppression systems will be integrated.
*   **Comfort Enhancements:** Passengers can anticipate improved air-conditioning, superior sound insulation for a quieter ride, modular washrooms, LED lighting, and ergonomic seating in the sleeper compartments. Each coach is also expected to have advanced passenger information systems.
*   **Speed Capability:** While primarily designed for long-distance travel, the sleeper rakes are projected to maintain the semi-high-speed capabilities characteristic of the Vande Bharat platform, enabling faster point-to-point connections on suitable tracks.
*   **Manufacturing:** The production of these rakes is anticipated to involve leading Indian manufacturers and public sector undertakings, bolstering domestic industrial capacity and technological expertise.

The phased rollout strategy will allow Indian Railways to strategically deploy these advanced trains on high-demand routes, optimising their impact on connectivity and passenger experience. This programme is an integral part of Indian Railways' long-term plan to modernise its entire fleet, ensuring that a significant portion of long-distance travel transitions to more technologically advanced and passenger-friendly options.

Looking ahead, the successful deployment of these Vande Bharat sleeper rakes is expected to redefine long-distance rail travel in India. The Ministry of Railways will likely issue further tenders and specific manufacturing timelines as the project progresses. The initial prototypes and trials will provide crucial data before the full-scale production and widespread introduction across the network, gradually integrating these modern trains into the fabric of Indian rail transportation.
