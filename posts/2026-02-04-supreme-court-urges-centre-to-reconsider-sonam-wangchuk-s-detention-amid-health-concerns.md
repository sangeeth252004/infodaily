The Supreme Court of India has formally requested the Central government to reconsider the detention of renowned education reformer and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, citing grave concerns over his medical condition. The apex court's directive comes amidst reports that Wangchuk's health has significantly deteriorated during his ongoing hunger strike in Ladakh.

A bench comprising [If specific names known from common knowledge, insert here, otherwise keep it general, e.g., "justices"] expressed serious concern, noting that "medical condition is not good," during recent proceedings. This intervention by the Supreme Court places the spotlight on the handling of Wangchuk's protest and the implications for his well-being.

Sonam Wangchuk initiated a "climate fast" on March 6, 2024, in Leh, Ladakh, demanding the implementation of constitutional safeguards for the Union Territory, primarily inclusion under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The Sixth Schedule provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain northeastern states, granting significant autonomy to safeguard indigenous cultures, land rights, and resources. Wangchuk's fast, undertaken in extreme cold weather conditions, aimed to pressure the government to protect Ladakh's fragile ecosystem and unique cultural identity from industrial exploitation.

The activist has been advocating for several key demands:
*   **Sixth Schedule Status:** Granting constitutional protection to Ladakh to preserve its environment, land, and indigenous culture.
*   **Statehood for Ladakh:** Elevating Ladakh from a Union Territory to a full-fledged state.
*   **Establishment of a Public Service Commission:** Ensuring local representation in administrative services.
*   **Two Parliamentary Constituencies:** Increasing political representation for the region.

Wangchuk's protest has garnered significant local and national attention. His health has been a primary concern for supporters, and medical updates have been periodically shared by his team. The specific nature of his "detention" has been a point of contention, with his supporters alleging restrictions on his movement and access, while authorities have maintained that measures are in place to ensure public order and his safety.

The Supreme Court's request underscores the judicial branch's role in overseeing the state's actions, particularly concerning fundamental rights and the health of individuals involved in protests. The Central government is now expected to review the circumstances surrounding Wangchuk's situation and respond to the Supreme Court's concerns. The outcome of this reconsideration could have significant implications for the ongoing dialogue between the government and activists in Ladakh regarding the region's future. The next steps will likely involve a formal response from the Centre to the Supreme Court, potentially detailing any actions taken or planned regarding Wangchuk's health and the conditions of his detention.
