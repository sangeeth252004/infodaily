An autonomy pact has been formally signed between the Government of India, the Government of Nagaland, and the Eastern Nagaland Peoples' Organisation (ENPO), granting enhanced administrative and financial powers to six districts in the state's eastern region. The agreement, concluded in New Delhi, marks a significant step towards addressing the long-standing demands for greater self-governance and accelerated development in the identified areas.

The agreement seeks to establish a new administrative arrangement designed to bolster local governance structures and channel resources more effectively into the region. It is anticipated to address the grievances of the Eastern Nagaland populace, who have advocated for improved infrastructure, economic opportunities, and control over their local affairs for decades. This pact is positioned as a framework for inclusive growth and stability, aiming to integrate the region more fully into the state's development trajectory while respecting unique regional aspirations.

The core of the agreement revolves around several key provisions intended to empower the local bodies and communities:

*   **Enhanced Administrative Powers:** The pact stipulates greater administrative control for local self-governing bodies over specific departments and functions relevant to the region.
*   **Special Development Package:** A substantial financial package is earmarked for the accelerated development of the six districts, focusing on critical sectors such as infrastructure, education, healthcare, and economic initiatives.
*   **New Governance Structure:** Details within the pact outline the establishment of a new administrative body or mechanism, comprising representatives from the local communities, to oversee the implementation of the agreement and manage allocated resources.
*   **Focus on Socio-Economic Upliftment:** The agreement emphasizes programs aimed at improving the socio-economic indicators of the region, which has historically lagged in various development metrics.

The six districts covered under this autonomy pact are:
*   Mon
*   Tuensang
*   Longleng
*   Kiphire
*   Noklak
*   Shamator

These districts collectively form the region represented by the ENPO, an apex body that has championed the cause for 'Frontier Nagaland' – a demand for a separate administrative unit within Nagaland, citing historical neglect and underdevelopment. The recent pact is a direct outcome of prolonged negotiations and consultations involving the Union Home Ministry, the Nagaland state government, and ENPO representatives, reflecting a concerted effort to find a mutually acceptable resolution.

Officials from the Union Home Ministry highlighted that the agreement underscores the government's commitment to inclusive development and addressing regional disparities through dialogue and constitutional means. Similarly, representatives from the Nagaland government have expressed optimism that the pact will foster greater harmony and accelerate progress across the state. The ENPO has welcomed the agreement as a positive development, viewing it as a foundation for genuine empowerment and sustainable growth for the people of Eastern Nagaland.

The immediate next steps involve the formalization of the new administrative mechanisms and the initiation of processes to disburse the allocated development funds. Further consultations are expected to refine the operational details and ensure transparent and effective implementation of the pact's provisions. Stakeholders will now focus on translating the agreement's terms into tangible benefits for the residents of the six districts, with emphasis on monitoring progress and ensuring accountability in governance.
