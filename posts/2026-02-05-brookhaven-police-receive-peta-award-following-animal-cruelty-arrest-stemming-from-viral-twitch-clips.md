On October 18, 2023, the Brookhaven Police Department in Georgia arrested Robert Nelson, known by his online alias "AspenKartier," on charges of felony animal cruelty. The arrest followed a prompt investigation triggered by viral video clips circulating on the streaming platform Twitch, which allegedly depicted Nelson hitting a puppy. The department's decisive action subsequently earned them recognition from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

The incident came to light after multiple viewers of Nelson's Twitch stream reported witnessing the alleged physical abuse of a puppy. The circulating clips reportedly showed Nelson repeatedly striking a crying puppy named Milo. As these videos gained traction across social media platforms, concerns from the online community escalated, leading to formal reports being filed with law enforcement.

Responding to these reports, the Brookhaven Police Department launched an investigation into the allegations. Detectives gathered evidence, including the widely shared video footage, to corroborate the claims of animal abuse. The investigation culminated in the execution of an arrest warrant for Robert Nelson. He was taken into custody and charged with felony animal cruelty, a serious offense under Georgia law, which pertains to alleged physical harm inflicted upon an animal. Nelson's online activities, particularly the live streaming of the alleged abuse, played a critical role in the swift dissemination of evidence that facilitated the investigation and subsequent arrest.

Crucially, the puppy, identified as Milo, was successfully rescued by authorities during the investigation. Following its rescue, Milo was placed under the care of animal welfare professionals and is currently in foster care, receiving necessary attention and rehabilitation.

PETA acknowledged the Brookhaven Police Department's effective response by presenting them with a "Compassionate Law Enforcement Award." The animal rights organization cited the department's prompt and thorough investigation as instrumental in holding the alleged abuser accountable and ensuring the puppy's immediate safety.
