As of June 19, 2024, daily gold prices for both 22K and 24K purity were updated across major Indian metropolitan areas. The rates, which fluctuate based on a combination of global and domestic factors, provide essential information for consumers planning purchases and investors monitoring the precious metal market. This daily assessment includes major cities such as Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Kolkata, among others, with slight variations observed between locations.

The price of gold is influenced by a complex interplay of international market trends, economic indicators, and domestic demand. Globally, factors such as the strength of the US dollar, crude oil prices, geopolitical tensions, and decisions by central banks regarding interest rates can significantly impact gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. Domestically, seasonal demand, particularly during festive and wedding seasons, along with state-specific taxes and local market dynamics, contribute to the final prices displayed to consumers. The daily updates are crucial for individuals making informed decisions regarding gold transactions.

Gold is primarily traded in two common purities in India: 22-carat (22K) and 24-carat (24K). 24K gold represents the purest form, typically 99.9% pure, and is primarily used for investments in bars, coins, and digital gold. Its price per 10 grams generally serves as the benchmark for the market. 22K gold, on the other hand, contains 91.6% gold mixed with other metals like copper or silver to enhance its durability, making it suitable for crafting intricate jewellery. Consequently, 22K gold is priced lower per 10 grams than its 24K counterpart due to its reduced purity.
