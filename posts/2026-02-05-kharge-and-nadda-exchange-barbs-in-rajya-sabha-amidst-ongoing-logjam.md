A sharp exchange of words unfolded in the Rajya Sabha on October 19, 2022, between Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of the House J.P. Nadda. The verbal spar, which saw Mr. Kharge allude to the BJP's "khujli" (itch) and Mr. Nadda respond by calling Mr. Kharge an "abodh balak" (innocent child), took place amidst persistent disruptions in the Upper House over various opposition demands.

The faceoff occurred during a session already marked by an ongoing parliamentary logjam, primarily fueled by opposition parties' protests concerning issues such as rising inflation and the imposition of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on essential commodities. This atmosphere of contention set the stage for the personal remarks exchanged by the senior leaders, further highlighting the strained relations between the treasury benches and the opposition.

The initial jibe came from Mr. Kharge, a senior Congress leader, who was critical of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He contended that the BJP consistently criticized India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, despite his historical contributions. Mr. Kharge remarked, "They keep scratching for 60 years," using the term "khujli" to imply an incessant and irritating habit of finding fault with past leaders. His statement aimed to underscore what he perceived as the BJP's persistent focus on historical criticism rather than contemporary issues.

In a swift rebuttal, Mr. Nadda, the BJP President and Leader of the House, countered Mr. Kharge's claims. He dismissed the remarks by referring to Mr. Kharge as an "abodh balak" (innocent child), suggesting a lack of understanding or awareness regarding the historical context of the BJP and its ideological predecessor, the Jana Sangh. Mr. Nadda pointed out that while Mr. Kharge claimed constant criticism over 60 years, the Jana Sangh was formed in 1951, and the BJP itself in 1980, implying that Mr. Kharge's historical timeline was inaccurate or deliberately misleading.

Key details of the exchange include:
*   **Participants:** Mallikarjun Kharge (Leader of Opposition, Rajya Sabha) and J.P. Nadda (Leader of the House, Rajya Sabha).
*   **Date:** October 19, 2022.
*   **Setting:** Rajya Sabha, India's Upper House of Parliament.
*   **Context:** Ongoing parliamentary logjam stemming from opposition demands on inflation and GST on essential items.
*   **Kharge's jibe:** Accused the BJP of having a "khujli" (itch) to criticize Jawaharlal Nehru for 60 years.
*   **Nadda's retort:** Referred to Kharge as an "abodh balak" (innocent child), disputing his historical understanding of the BJP's origins.

Such direct personal exchanges among senior parliamentary figures are indicative of the heightened political tension that characterized the session. While parliamentary debates often involve sharp criticisms of policies and ideologies, the resort to personal jibes can escalate friction and potentially detract from constructive legislative work. The continued logjam means that several crucial bills and discussions faced delays, impacting the Parliament's legislative agenda.

The incident underscores the challenges in maintaining parliamentary decorum amidst deep ideological divides and an aggressive political climate. With the logjam persisting, the focus remained on efforts by presiding officers and floor leaders to restore order and allow for the smooth functioning of legislative business in the upcoming sessions. The resolution of the underlying issues driving the opposition's protests, alongside a commitment to respectful debate, remained crucial for the Parliament's effective operation.
