Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently asserted that India's recent engagements and agreements with the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) represent a positive indicator for global stability. Speaking during a session in the Rajya Sabha, India's upper house of Parliament, Mr. Modi articulated this perspective while discussing India's evolving foreign policy and its role in the international order. His remarks underscore the government's view of these partnerships as crucial for not only India's strategic interests but also for broader international peace and security.

The Prime Minister's statement in New Delhi highlighted the strategic importance of these bilateral and multi-lateral collaborations. India has been actively pursuing deeper ties with both the EU and the US across various sectors, including trade, technology, defense, and climate change. These efforts are viewed within India's diplomatic circles as instrumental in diversifying its global partnerships and enhancing its influence on the world stage. Mr. Modi's emphasis on "world stability" suggests a broader geopolitical context for these agreements, positioning India as a significant contributor to maintaining international order through constructive engagement.

India's relationship with the European Union, a bloc of 27 member states, has seen renewed vigor in recent years. Discussions have progressed on a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA), alongside cooperation in areas such as digital transformation, sustainable development, and security. Similarly, the strategic partnership between India and the United States has expanded significantly, encompassing dialogues on critical technologies, defense procurement, intelligence sharing, and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. These engagements reflect a shared commitment to a rules-based international order and addressing common global challenges.

The Prime Minister's assertion comes amid a complex global landscape marked by evolving geopolitical alignments and economic shifts. By framing these deals as beneficial for world stability, Mr. Modi positions India's foreign policy as one aimed at promoting equilibrium and cooperation rather than solely national interest. This narrative aligns with India's long-standing diplomatic approach of non-alignment, now often reinterpreted as multi-alignment, where it seeks to maintain strong relationships with diverse global powers without being exclusively tied to any single bloc.

Recent high-level interactions between Indian officials and their EU and US counterparts underscore this collaborative push. These have included ministerial dialogues, strategic consultations, and joint working groups focused on enhancing economic resilience, strengthening supply chains, and addressing emergent security threats. The focus areas for collaboration frequently include green energy initiatives, enhancing digital infrastructure, and fostering innovation ecosystems, all contributing to a more interconnected and potentially stable global economy.

Looking ahead, India is expected to continue its proactive diplomatic outreach to both the European Union and the United States. Observers anticipate further progress on ongoing negotiations, such as the India-EU FTA, and continued deepening of strategic and defense cooperation with the US. These ongoing dialogues and partnerships are central to India's vision for a multipolar world and its strategy to navigate contemporary international challenges, with the stated aim of contributing to overall global stability.
