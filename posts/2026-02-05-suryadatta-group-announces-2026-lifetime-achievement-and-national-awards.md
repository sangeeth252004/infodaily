Pune, India – The Suryadatta Group of Institutes (SGI) in Pune has officially announced its "Suryadatta Lifetime Achievement Awards 2026" and "Suryadatta National Awards 2026," initiating the nomination process for these recognitions. The announcement, made in late 2022, sets the stage for a comprehensive selection process culminating in a grand felicitation ceremony in 2026, celebrating significant contributions to national development.

The awards aim to honor individuals and organizations whose efforts have demonstrably contributed to various facets of nation-building, encompassing fields such as education, industry, social work, arts, science, and public service. This initiative aligns with Suryadatta's long-standing commitment to recognizing excellence and inspiring future generations of leaders and innovators.

According to Prof. Dr. Sanjay B. Chordiya, Founder President and Chairman of SGI, the awards serve as a platform to acknowledge the selfless service and dedication of professionals who have made a tangible impact on society. The institution emphasized that these awards are a continuation of a tradition spanning over two and a half decades, with 2026 marking the 27th consecutive year of their conferment.

The awards are categorized to address different levels and types of contributions:

*   **Suryadatta Lifetime Achievement Awards 2026:** This category is specifically designed to honor senior citizens who have dedicated their lives to exceptional service and have made profound, sustained contributions to the nation over several decades. It recognizes individuals whose legacy continues to inspire and uplift communities.
*   **Suryadatta National Awards 2026:** This award targets young and dynamic professionals, entrepreneurs, educators, and achievers who have demonstrated outstanding performance and innovative approaches in their respective fields. It seeks to acknowledge contemporary leadership and impactful work that is shaping the present and future of the country.

The nomination process for both award categories is now open to individuals and organizations across India. Prospective candidates, or those wishing to nominate deserving individuals, are encouraged to submit comprehensive applications detailing the nominee's achievements, impact, and contributions. An eminent jury, comprising distinguished personalities from various sectors, will undertake a rigorous evaluation process to select the final awardees. This multi-stage process ensures impartiality and acknowledges meritorious work based on clearly defined criteria.

The recipients of the Suryadatta Lifetime Achievement and National Awards 2026 will be felicitated during the "Suryadatta Annual Convocation & Awards Ceremony 2026." This event traditionally brings together academic luminaries, industry leaders, public figures, and students, providing a prominent platform to celebrate the awardees' accomplishments and share their inspiring journeys.

The announcement underscores Suryadatta Group's role not only as an educational institution but also as a proactive participant in fostering a culture of excellence and recognition within the national landscape.
