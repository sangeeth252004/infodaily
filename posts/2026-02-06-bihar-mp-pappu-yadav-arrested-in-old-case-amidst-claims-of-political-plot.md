Patna police arrested former Member of Parliament and Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) founder Pappu Yadav from his Mandiri residence in Patna on the morning of May 11, 2021. The arrest, made in connection with a 32-year-old abduction case, followed hours of high drama at Yadav's home where he refused entry to officers, claiming the action was part of a political "plot to kill" him.

The police team arrived at Yadav's residence citing his alleged violation of lockdown norms by travelling extensively across the state. However, the arrest was ultimately linked to an old case, specifically Case No. 269/1989 registered at the Murliganj police station in Madhepura district, pertaining to an alleged abduction and assault. Yadav, whose real name is Rajesh Ranjan, initially resisted the police, communicating with media and supporters through live video streams and social media, asserting his innocence and accusing the state government of political vendetta.

Yadav had recently gained prominence for his activism during the severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. He had been vocal in highlighting alleged shortages of oxygen, hospital beds, and vital medicines like Remdesivir in Bihar. His activities included raiding private premises to unearth what he claimed were hoarded medical supplies and visiting hospitals to expose deficiencies in healthcare infrastructure.

Key details surrounding the arrest and Yadav's claims include:

*   **The Charges:** While police initially cited lockdown violations for his recent movements, the formal arrest was based on a non-bailable warrant issued in the 1989 abduction case. This particular case had seen Yadav granted bail by the high court, but the Supreme Court later cancelled the bail in 2021, leading to the warrant.
*   **Yadav's Allegations:** He vehemently denied the charges, asserting that the arrest was orchestrated by the then ruling JD(U)-BJP alliance in Bihar. He linked the police action directly to his efforts in exposing alleged corruption and mismanagement during the COVID-19 crisis, particularly his accusations against BJP MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy regarding alleged hoarding of ambulances and his pursuit of alleged Remdesivir hoarders.
*   **Confrontation at Residence:** Yadav refused to open his gates for an extended period, leading to a standoff. He used social media to appeal to his supporters and highlight what he termed an injustice.
*   **Political Reaction:** The arrest drew mixed reactions. While opposition parties criticized the state government for what they called politically motivated actions against a vocal critic, the ruling alliance largely remained silent or defended the police action as adherence to legal procedures.

Following his eventual cooperation, Pappu Yadav was taken to the Gandhi Maidan police station for interrogation. He underwent a medical check-up at Sadar Hospital before being produced before a judicial magistrate. The court subsequently sent him to 14 days of judicial custody, following which he was reportedly transferred to Saharsa jail.

The legal proceedings surrounding the 1989 case are expected to continue, with Yadav's legal team likely to challenge the arrest and seek bail. The incident underscored the contentious political environment in Bihar, particularly amidst the backdrop of the public health crisis, and highlighted the tensions between political activism and state authority.
