Gold prices for 22-carat and 24-carat purity were updated across major Indian metropolitan areas on Thursday, February 6, 2026. The daily revision saw rates per 10 grams set for key cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bengaluru, reflecting current market dynamics. These daily updates are crucial for investors, consumers, and the jewelry industry, providing a benchmark for transactions involving the precious metal.

The fluctuation in gold prices is influenced by a confluence of global and domestic factors. Internationally, movements in the US dollar, crude oil prices, and geopolitical events often impact gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. Domestically, factors such as festival demand, import duties, and government policies also play a significant role in shaping local rates. On February 6, 2026, market data indicated varied pricing across cities, primarily due to state-specific taxes, local premiums, and transportation costs. The rates are typically compiled from bullion market associations and local jewelers, reflecting the average trading price for the day.

For consumers, the daily gold price updates are essential for purchasing jewelry, coins, or bars, especially during peak seasons like weddings and festivals. Investors monitor these rates closely as gold serves as a traditional hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The jewelry manufacturing sector, a significant contributor to India's economy, relies on these daily benchmarks for inventory management and pricing strategies. The transparency provided by regular price disclosures helps maintain market integrity and consumer confidence in gold transactions.
