The Directorate of Medical Education (DME), Madhya Pradesh, has officially released the merit list for Round 3 of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Postgraduate (NEET PG) Counselling 2025. This latest update confirms that 5,344 candidates have qualified, making them eligible for admission to various postgraduate medical and dental courses within state-run and private institutions. The comprehensive list is now accessible for public review on the official DME Madhya Pradesh counselling portal.

The release of the Round 3 merit list marks a pivotal development for thousands of medical graduates seeking to pursue MD, MS, or MDS specializations in Madhya Pradesh. NEET PG serves as the single entrance examination for postgraduate medical admissions across India, and state-level counselling, managed by bodies like DME MP, is responsible for allocating 85% of the state quota seats. This third round is particularly significant as it aims to fill seats that remained vacant after the completion of the first two rounds, including those vacated due to candidates upgrading or not reporting.

Candidates who have successfully qualified in this round are now poised to move to the subsequent crucial stages of the admission process. These typically involve online choice filling, where aspirants meticulously select their preferred colleges and medical specialities based on their merit rank and availability. Following the choice submission, the DME MP will process these preferences and subsequently publish the Round 3 seat allotment result. This allocation will be determined by the candidates' NEET PG 2025 ranks, choices filled, category, and the prevailing reservation policies.

Key details regarding the MP NEET PG Counselling 2025 Round 3 include:
*   **Examination:** National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Postgraduate (NEET PG) 2025
*   **Issuing Authority:** Directorate of Medical Education (DME), Madhya Pradesh
*   **Counselling Phase:** Round 3

Qualified candidates are strongly advised to consult the official counselling schedule published by the DME MP without delay. Strict adherence to specified dates for choice locking, downloading provisional allotment letters, and reporting to the allotted institutions for document verification and fee payment is imperative. Any failure to meet these deadlines could result in forfeiture of the allotted seat. This round represents a crucial opportunity for many aspirants to secure their desired postgraduate medical or dental seat for the 2025 academic session.
