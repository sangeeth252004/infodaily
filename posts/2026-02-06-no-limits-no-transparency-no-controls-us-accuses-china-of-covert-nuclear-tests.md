The United States has formally accused China of conducting covert nuclear tests, citing a profound lack of transparency and verifiable controls within Beijing's rapidly expanding nuclear weapons program. This accusation, made by high-ranking US officials, signals escalating concerns in Washington regarding China's refusal to engage in international arms control negotiations.

Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins publicly articulated the US position, stating that China’s nuclear activities currently operate with “no limits, no transparency, no controls.” This statement underscores Washington's view that Beijing's ongoing refusal to negotiate limits on its nuclear arsenal is "deeply destabilizing" for global security. US officials pointed to activities at China’s Lop Nur nuclear test site, alleging potential low-yield tests and questioning Beijing's adherence to the "zero-yield" standard of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), despite China not having ratified the treaty.

The US has repeatedly called for a new, expanded arms control treaty that would encompass China alongside the United States and Russia. The current New START treaty, a bilateral agreement between Washington and Moscow, was extended until 2026 but does not include China’s nuclear forces. China has consistently declined invitations to join such discussions, asserting that its arsenal is relatively small, designed purely for self-defense, and therefore not yet suitable for arms control agreements. This stance contrasts sharply with US assessments, which indicate China is undertaking a "significant expansion" of its nuclear capabilities.

US officials have drawn comparisons between China's current opaque approach to nuclear development and the Soviet Union’s secretive activities during the Cold War. This lack of verifiable information and non-participation in established arms control mechanisms is a primary source of concern for the United States. Beijing's non-ratification of the CTBT and the alleged activities at Lop Nur are cited as concrete examples of this opacity, hindering international efforts to monitor and manage nuclear proliferation risks.

The United States continues to advocate for a trilateral arms control framework involving all three major nuclear powers to enhance global strategic stability. The persistent rhetoric from Washington highlights the growing strategic competition and the significant challenges in establishing new international norms for nuclear arms control. Future diplomatic efforts are expected to focus on encouraging China's participation in these critical discussions, though Beijing's current position suggests continued resistance to formal limitations on its nuclear program.
