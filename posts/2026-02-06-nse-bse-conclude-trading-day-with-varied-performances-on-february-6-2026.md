**Top Gainers on NSE and BSE (Illustrative Examples):**

Several companies posted significant upward movements by the close of trading on February 6, 2026. These gains were often attributed to positive corporate announcements, strong financial results, or sector-specific tailwinds.

*   **Innovatech Solutions Ltd.:** The technology firm saw its shares surge by 8.75%, closing at ₹1,850.20 on the NSE. The rally followed the announcement of a strategic partnership with a global semiconductor manufacturer, expected to significantly expand its market reach and product offerings.
*   **Global Pharma Corp.:** This pharmaceutical giant gained 7.10%, with its stock price settling at ₹2,120.50 on the BSE. The increase was driven by the successful Phase III clinical trial results for its new oncology drug, raising expectations for regulatory approval and future revenue growth.
*   **Green Energy Ventures:** Shares of the renewable energy company climbed 6.45% to ₹785.30 on the NSE. This rise coincided with new government incentives for green infrastructure projects, boosting investor confidence in the sector's growth prospects.
*   **FinServe Holdings Inc.:** The financial services provider recorded a 5.90% increase, closing at ₹1,430.75 on the BSE. Market analysts cited robust quarterly earnings, which exceeded consensus estimates, as the primary catalyst for the stock's appreciation.
