Police in Dhaka, Bangladesh, deployed sound grenades and tear gas to disperse opposition activists and protesters near the residence of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus in Dhanmondi on Sunday, September 13, 2015. The incident occurred amidst heightened political tension and an ongoing series of protests by the opposition alliance, which included supporters of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Khaleda Zia.

The demonstrators had gathered to demand the release of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and the holding of fresh general elections under a non-party caretaker government. Reports indicated that a group of protesters attempted to march towards the Prime Minister's Office, prompting law enforcement personnel to intervene and use crowd control measures.

This event was part of a broader period of political unrest in Bangladesh, characterized by an opposition-led blockade and strikes (hartals) that had commenced on January 5, 2015. The opposition alliance consistently called for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her government, advocating for new polls. The clashes near Yunus's residence underscore the volatile political climate that prevailed during this period.

Key details surrounding the incident:
*   **Location:** The area around Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus's residence in Dhanmondi, a residential area in Dhaka. Yunus himself was reportedly safe inside his home and not involved in the protests.
*   **Methods of Dispersion:** Police utilized sound grenades, also known as stun grenades, and tear gas canisters to scatter the protesting crowd.
*   **Protester Demands:** The primary objectives of the protesters included securing the release of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia from house arrest and compelling the government to organize new elections.
*   **Injuries Reported:** Several protesters sustained injuries during the police action. Additionally, a journalist working for the private television channel RTV was also reported to have been injured while covering the events.

The use of force near a prominent public figure's home drew attention to the ongoing political standoff. The opposition alliance, led by the BNP, had sustained its protest campaign for several months, often resulting in confrontations with law enforcement. These demonstrations frequently escalated into violence, disrupting daily life and economic activities across the nation.

Another similar incident was reported on the same day when sound grenades were also reportedly used near the residence of BNP joint secretary general Salahuddin Ahmed in Gulshan. These actions highlighted the government's firm stance against the opposition's protracted agitation. The political crisis in Bangladesh continued to unfold with periodic clashes and stalemates between the ruling Awami League and the opposition alliance during 2015, with no immediate resolution in sight for the fundamental disagreements over the electoral process and government legitimacy.
