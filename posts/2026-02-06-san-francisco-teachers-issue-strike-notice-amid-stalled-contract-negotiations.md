San Francisco, California – The United Educators of San Francisco (UESF), the union representing thousands of teachers and other educators in the city, issued a formal strike notice on November 20, 2023, following an extended period of unsuccessful contract negotiations with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). This development signals a potential work stoppage that could disrupt educational services for approximately 49,000 students across 114 schools in the district.

The decision to issue a strike notice came after months of discussions failed to yield a new collective bargaining agreement. Key points of contention include teacher salaries, healthcare benefits, and classroom conditions. UESF leadership has consistently articulated that current compensation levels are insufficient to retain experienced educators and attract new talent in a city with one of the nation's highest costs of living. The union also seeks improvements in working conditions, including manageable class sizes and increased support for special education programs.

Negotiations between UESF and SFUSD have been ongoing since April 2023, with both parties engaged in multiple rounds of talks. Despite efforts from a state-appointed mediator in recent weeks, significant disagreements persist regarding the financial terms of the new contract. UESF members voted to authorize a strike in late October, demonstrating widespread support for the union’s demands if an agreement could not be reached.

*   **Key Union Demands (as reported by UESF):**
    *   A significant percentage wage increase over the next three years to address cost-of-living challenges.
    *   Comprehensive enhancements to healthcare and retirement benefits.
    *   Stricter limits on class sizes across all grade levels to improve learning environments.
    *   Increased funding for essential classroom resources and professional development opportunities.
    *   Improved support for mental health services for both students and staff.

*   **San Francisco Unified School District Position:**
    *   Acknowledges the need for competitive compensation to attract and retain high-quality educators.
    *   Cites ongoing fiscal challenges and budget constraints as limiting factors in negotiations.
    *   Has offered a lower percentage wage increase and benefit adjustments, stating these are within the district's financial capacity.
    *   Expressed a commitment to reaching an amicable resolution to avoid a strike.

The SFUSD has stated that it is reviewing contingency plans should a strike occur, which could involve temporary school closures or a transition to remote learning, impacting thousands of families relying on in-person instruction and school services. Parents have expressed concerns over potential childcare issues and the continuity of their children's education.

The issuance of a strike notice initiates a legally mandated period before a full work stoppage can commence. Both UESF and SFUSD representatives have indicated a willingness to continue negotiations, potentially with further mediation, in an effort to avert a strike. The exact date for a potential strike would be announced by UESF leadership following any further developments in the coming weeks.
