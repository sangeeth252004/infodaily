The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has announced a significant overhaul of its examination centre allocation policy for the Civil Services Examination (CSE) 2026. This new approach, effective from the application window opening in 2025 for the CSE 2026, is specifically designed to enhance accessibility and convenience for Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) candidates, aiming to provide them with examination centres closer to their residences.

Under the revised system, the UPSC, responsible for conducting one of India's most competitive examinations, will implement a two-stage application process for centre selection. The primary objective is to facilitate PwBD candidates by offering them examination centres at their district headquarters or the nearest accessible district headquarters, thereby mitigating travel difficulties and logistical challenges often encountered by individuals with disabilities. This initiative marks a targeted effort by the UPSC to align its examination procedures with principles of greater inclusivity and robust support for disabled candidates, reflecting a broader national emphasis on the rights and opportunities for PwBD.

The first stage of the application process will involve an early window specifically for PwBD candidates to indicate their preferred examination centres. This early registration is crucial as it will allow the UPSC to assess demand and make necessary logistical arrangements, such as ensuring accessible infrastructure and support staff, well in advance of the examination. Following this priority allocation, a general application window will open for all other candidates, who will then select from the remaining available centres. The long-standing 'first-apply-first-allot' principle will continue to apply for non-PwBD candidates within this general phase.

This policy shift directly addresses a long-standing need for improved physical and geographical accessibility in national competitive examinations. By prioritising PwBD candidates' centre choices and offering district-level options, the UPSC aims to substantially reduce the physical, financial, and logistical burden associated with appearing for the demanding Civil Services Examination. The move is widely seen as a progressive step towards fostering a more equitable testing environment, potentially encouraging greater participation from qualified disabled individuals in the pursuit of a career in the civil services.

Key features of the new centre allocation policy for CSE 2026 include:
*   **Two-Stage Application Process:** An initial, early application window specifically for PwBD candidates, followed by a general application window for all other candidates.
*   **Prioritised PwBD Allocation:** PwBD candidates will be offered examination centres at their district headquarters or the closest available district headquarters.
*   **Enhanced Accessibility:** The policy aims to reduce travel and logistical challenges for PwBD candidates by providing centre options closer to their homes.
*   **First-Apply-First-Allot for Others:** The principle of 'first-apply-first-allot' will continue to apply to non-PwBD candidates within the general application window, based on available centres after PwBD allocations.
*   **Implementation Timeline:** The new system will be in effect for the Civil Services Examination 2026, with the first application window scheduled to open in 2025.

The UPSC's decision underscores a commitment to adapting its administrative processes to promote wider participation and support for all candidate categories. The effectiveness of this new centre allocation strategy will be observed as the application process for CSE 2026 commences next year, with stakeholders monitoring its impact on candidate experience and accessibility outcomes across the nation.
