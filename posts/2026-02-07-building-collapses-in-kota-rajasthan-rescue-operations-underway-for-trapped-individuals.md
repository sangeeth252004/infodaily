A three-storeyed building collapsed in the Prem Nagar area of Kota, Rajasthan, early Tuesday morning, trapping multiple individuals beneath the rubble. Emergency services immediately launched a large-scale rescue operation, mobilizing specialized teams to the site of the incident. The collapse, which occurred in a densely populated residential locality, has prompted a coordinated response from local and state disaster management authorities.

Following the alarm, local police and fire brigade units were among the first responders, swiftly securing the perimeter and assessing the immediate situation. They were soon joined by personnel from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). These specialized teams, equipped with advanced search and rescue tools, are actively working to locate and extricate individuals believed to be caught under the collapsed structure. Heavy machinery, including JCBs and excavators, has been deployed to methodically clear debris and create access points for rescuers.

The challenging conditions at the site include large amounts of concrete, twisted metal, and dust, complicating rescue efforts. Teams are employing techniques such as sniffer dogs and thermal scanners to detect signs of life within the wreckage. Local residents have also gathered near the cordoned-off area, providing information about potential occupants and assisting where possible, though direct access to the collapse zone is restricted for safety reasons. District administration officials, including the District Collector and senior police officers, are present at the scene to oversee the operation and ensure seamless coordination among various agencies.

The building, reportedly an older structure, housed multiple floors. While the exact number of people trapped remains unconfirmed by officials at this hour, rescue personnel are operating on the premise that several individuals were inside at the time of the collapse. Focus remains squarely on life-saving efforts, with medical teams and ambulances on standby to provide immediate care to anyone successfully extricated.
