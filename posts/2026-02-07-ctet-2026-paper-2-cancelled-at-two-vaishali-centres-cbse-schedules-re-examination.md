The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has announced the cancellation of Paper 2 of the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) 2026 at two designated examination centres in the Vaishali district of Bihar. The decision impacts all candidates who appeared for the examination at these specific locations. The board has confirmed its commitment to conduct a re-examination for the affected candidates within 15 days of the original examination date.

The CTET examination is a critical national-level assessment conducted by the CBSE to determine candidates' eligibility for teaching positions in central government schools and other schools that recognize CTET certification. Paper 2 of the CTET qualifies individuals to teach classes 6 to 8, making its successful completion a prerequisite for numerous teaching aspirants across India. The integrity of this examination is paramount, and cancellations are typically initiated to uphold fairness and transparency.

According to the official announcement from CBSE, the cancellation was implemented due to administrative reasons that compromised the sanctity of the examination process at the two specific centres. The board did not elaborate on the precise nature of these administrative issues. The swift decision to cancel and reschedule aims to ensure that all candidates are evaluated under uniform and secure conditions, maintaining the credibility of the CTET certification.

Key details regarding the cancellation and re-examination include:
*   **Affected Exam:** CTET 2026, Paper 2.
*   **Affected Locations:** Two specific examination centres within the Vaishali district, Bihar.
*   **Reason for Cancellation:** Administrative reasons, as stated by the CBSE.
*   **Re-examination Timeline:** A new examination for the affected candidates will be conducted within 15 days of the original test date.
*   **Authority:** The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

This development requires candidates who were allotted to these two centres in Vaishali to prepare for an additional examination within a condensed timeframe. The CBSE has assured that efforts are being made to minimize inconvenience to the candidates and to facilitate a smooth re-examination process.

Candidates affected by this cancellation are strongly advised to regularly monitor the official CTET website, `ctet.nic.in`, for the most recent updates. The board is expected to release further notifications detailing the exact dates, revised admit card issuance, and specific guidelines pertaining to the re-examination. These announcements will be crucial for candidates to prepare adequately and adhere to the new schedule. The CBSE reiterates its dedication to a fair and transparent examination system for all individuals aspiring to join the teaching profession.
