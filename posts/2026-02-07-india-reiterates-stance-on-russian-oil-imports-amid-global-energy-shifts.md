New Delhi, India – India has reiterated its consistent position regarding the procurement of crude oil from Russia, emphasizing national energy security and the imperative to ensure affordable and stable energy supplies for its populace. The reaffirmation comes as global energy markets continue to navigate geopolitical shifts and supply chain adjustments following the conflict in Ukraine.

Senior Indian government officials have consistently articulated that the nation’s energy purchasing decisions are guided by its economic interests and the necessity to meet the demands of its growing economy. India, as the world's third-largest oil consumer and importer, prioritizes diversification of its energy portfolio and seeks advantageous terms from various global suppliers to mitigate market volatility.

Prior to February 2022, Russian crude constituted a negligible portion of India’s total oil imports, often less than 1%. However, market data and trade reports indicate a significant shift, with Russia emerging as a major supplier to India. This change reflects a strategic move by India to capitalize on discounted crude prices offered by Russia, which have become available as Western nations imposed sanctions and sought to reduce their reliance on Russian energy.

The Indian government has maintained that its procurement of Russian oil does not contravene any international sanctions, as it has not joined Western-led embargoes. Officials have clarified that India's energy policy remains independent and is designed to serve its sovereign interests. This stance underscores a broader principle of India's foreign policy: maintaining strategic autonomy while navigating complex international relations.

Key aspects of India’s energy sourcing strategy include:

*   **Energy Security:** Ensuring an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to fuel industrial growth and meet consumer demand across the country.
*   **Affordability:** Securing energy resources at competitive prices to manage inflation and support economic stability.
*   **Diversification:** Reducing over-reliance on any single region or supplier, thereby enhancing resilience against supply shocks.
*   **National Interest:** Making decisions based on the welfare of Indian citizens and the sustainability of the national economy.

The increased imports from Russia have allowed India to stabilize its energy costs to some extent, despite fluctuating global prices. Crude oil is a critical input for various sectors of the Indian economy, including transportation, manufacturing, and petrochemicals. The ability to source oil at favorable rates directly impacts inflation and the cost of living for millions of Indians.

Looking ahead, India's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has indicated that the nation will continue to monitor global energy dynamics closely and adapt its sourcing strategy as necessary. The government's focus remains on maintaining a balanced approach to its energy imports, ensuring reliability and cost-effectiveness from diverse international sources while upholding its commitment to national development and energy independence. The evolving landscape of global energy trade suggests that India's pragmatic approach to securing its energy future will continue to be a defining feature of its economic policy.
