New Delhi – In February 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly acknowledged the strengthening of India's 'Make in India' initiative through bilateral agreements with the United States, expressing gratitude to then-US President Barack Obama during his historic visit to New Delhi. The statements underscored India's ambition to transform into a global manufacturing hub and reduce its reliance on foreign imports, particularly in critical sectors like defense.

The Prime Minister’s remarks followed extensive discussions aimed at deepening the strategic partnership between the two nations. A central theme of the talks revolved around enhancing defense cooperation, moving beyond a traditional buyer-seller relationship to one of co-production and co-development. This approach was presented as a significant step towards enabling India to indigenously manufacture advanced defense equipment, thereby bolstering its industrial base and technological capabilities.

Key details from the bilateral engagements in 2015 included:
*   **Defense Technology Cooperation:** Discussions centered on specific projects for co-production and co-development of defense items. These included potential collaborations on maritime surveillance drones, such as General Atomics’ Guardian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and advanced jet engine technology.
*   **'Make in India' Initiative:** The agreements were framed as pivotal for the 'Make in India' campaign, launched in September 2014. The initiative aimed to encourage both multinational and domestic companies to manufacture their products in India, fostering job creation, skill development, and technology transfer.
*   **Strategic Partnership:** The visit and subsequent agreements were highlighted as a demonstration of the evolving strategic partnership between India and the United States, signifying a shared commitment to regional stability and economic growth through enhanced collaboration across various sectors.
*   **Investment and Trade:** Beyond defense, the leaders discussed increasing US investment in India and streamlining trade processes, projecting a positive outlook for bilateral economic ties.

Prime Minister Modi's emphasis on the 'Make in India' aspect aimed to highlight the long-term economic and strategic benefits for India, beyond immediate procurements. The intent was to secure not just equipment, but also the intellectual property, manufacturing know-how, and skilled employment associated with advanced defense production. This approach sought to build India's industrial self-reliance and reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers over time.

The 2015 discussions set a significant precedent for future India-US collaboration in defense and technology. The commitment to joint production and technology sharing laid foundational groundwork for subsequent bilateral engagements, contributing to the ongoing evolution of India's defense manufacturing sector and its broader technological advancement under the 'Make in India' framework. The agreements reflected a strategic shift towards fostering India's indigenous capabilities in areas critical for national security and economic development.
