The United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) has issued a comprehensive advisory for its citizens currently residing in or planning to travel to Spain. The warning comes in response to severe weather conditions brought by Storm Leonardo, which has triggered widespread flooding and necessitated evacuations in various regions across the Iberian nation. UAE diplomatic missions, including the Embassy in Madrid and the Consulate General in Barcelona, are actively monitoring the situation and have urged citizens to exercise extreme caution and adhere to local safety directives.

Storm Leonardo is characterized by torrential rainfall, strong winds, and high sea levels, leading to significant disruption across affected areas. Reports indicate widespread flooding, particularly in coastal and low-lying regions, resulting in infrastructure damage, road closures, and disruptions to public services. Local authorities in Spain have initiated emergency response protocols, including the evacuation of residents from high-risk zones, to ensure public safety amid the escalating weather event. The intensity of the storm has created hazardous conditions, posing risks to both residents and visitors.

In its official communication, the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed the importance of citizen safety and provided specific guidance. All UAE nationals in Spain are strongly advised to register with the "Tawajudi" service. This vital registration platform enables the Ministry and its diplomatic missions to establish contact with citizens during emergencies, provide necessary assistance, and ensure their well-being. The Ministry emphasized that registered citizens would receive direct updates and guidance from the Embassy or Consulate General.

Further directives from the UAE diplomatic missions include:
*   **Exercising Extreme Caution:** Citizens are urged to remain vigilant, avoid unnecessary travel, and stay indoors if possible, especially in areas heavily impacted by the storm.
*   **Following Local Authorities:** Strict adherence to instructions issued by Spanish emergency services and local authorities is paramount for personal safety. This includes evacuation orders and traffic advisories.
*   **Staying Informed:** Citizens should regularly monitor local news and weather forecasts for updates on Storm Leonardo's trajectory and impact.
*   **Contacting Diplomatic Missions:** In case of emergency or for any required assistance, UAE citizens are advised to contact the UAE Embassy in Madrid or the Consulate General in Barcelona. Specific emergency contact numbers have been disseminated through official channels and the Tawajudi service.

The proactive advisory reflects the UAE government's commitment to safeguarding its citizens abroad, especially during unforeseen natural events. The severe weather conditions associated with Storm Leonardo have already caused significant logistical challenges and safety concerns, making the timely guidance from diplomatic missions crucial for UAE nationals.

UAE diplomatic missions in Spain continue to monitor the situation closely, maintaining constant communication with local emergency services and providing updates as the storm progresses. Citizens are encouraged to remain connected with the Embassy and Consulate General for ongoing support and information until the weather conditions stabilize and the immediate threat from Storm Leonardo subsides.
