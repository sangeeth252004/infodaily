**LUCKNOW, UTTAR PRADESH** – The Uttar Pradesh government has announced a third extension for filing claims pertaining to its State Industrial Region (SIR) scheme, granting stakeholders an additional month to complete their submissions. This latest directive aims to accommodate a higher volume of applicants and address operational challenges experienced during previous filing periods.

The decision was formalized through an official notification issued by the Department of Industrial Development, Uttar Pradesh, earlier this week. This marks the third time the deadline for the SIR scheme claims has been extended, underscoring the state's intent to ensure comprehensive participation and resolution of issues for all eligible entities and individuals.

The Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Region (SIR) scheme is a key initiative designed to bolster industrial growth and attract investment across designated regions within the state. It involves various provisions, including land allocation, infrastructure development, and compensatory frameworks for affected parties or benefits for project stakeholders. Claims typically encompass matters such as land acquisition compensation, environmental compliance, infrastructure access, and other related grievances or entitlements under the scheme's guidelines.

Officials cited persistent public requests and the ongoing processing of a large number of applications as primary reasons for the repeated extensions. The initial deadline for claim submissions had been set several months prior, followed by two subsequent extensions each lasting approximately one month. This latest extension pushes the final submission date to a new undisclosed date next month, providing what authorities have indicated will be the last opportunity for claimants. The exact number of claims filed to date or awaiting submission was not disclosed, but sources within the department suggest thousands of potential claimants are involved.

The repeated extensions are expected to provide significant relief to numerous stakeholders, including landowners, industrial units, and local communities directly or indirectly impacted by the SIR developments. Many claimants reportedly require additional time to gather requisite documentation, secure necessary legal counsel, or navigate the digital filing platforms. The Department of Industrial Development has emphasized its commitment to a transparent and inclusive process, utilizing digital portals for claim submissions to enhance accessibility and efficiency, even as it addresses system capacity and user support.

*   **Previous Extensions:** The current extension follows two prior postponements of the claim filing deadline, each adding approximately 30 days.
*   **Objective:** To ensure all eligible parties have sufficient opportunity to submit their claims without undue pressure or technical impediment.
*   **Impact:** Offers relief to a broad spectrum of claimants, facilitating thorough preparation and submission of required documentation.

State authorities have urged all remaining eligible individuals and entities to utilize this final month-long window to submit their claims. They have advised claimants to consult the official portal and designated support centers for assistance and to ensure compliance with all documentation requirements. No further extensions are anticipated following the expiration of this latest deadline, according to department spokespersons. The administration has reiterated its commitment to processing all submitted claims efficiently to facilitate the smooth implementation and continued progress of the Uttar Pradesh SIR scheme.
