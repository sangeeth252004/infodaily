Mumbai, India – Promising domestic cricketer Vaibhav Sooryavanshi will be unavailable for national selection consideration for approximately eight to ten weeks, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed in an official medical update released on October 26, 2023. The 20-year-old left-handed batsman sustained a Grade 2 hamstring tear during a recent Ranji Trophy match, necessitating a period of recovery and rehabilitation.

Sooryavanshi, who has been under close observation by national selectors following a strong performance in the recent domestic circuit, will miss India's upcoming three-match T20I series against South Africa, scheduled to commence on November 15. His absence also means he will not participate in the preparatory camp at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, which was slated to begin next week. The BCCI's medical panel assessed Sooryavanshi's condition and advised the extended rest and rehabilitation period to ensure complete recovery and prevent recurrence.

The injury occurred on October 20, during the second innings of a Ranji Trophy fixture between Jharkhand and Bihar, where Sooryavanshi was batting. He immediately reported discomfort and subsequently underwent medical scans that confirmed the extent of the tear. Following the diagnosis, the BCCI's medical team took charge of his case, outlining a comprehensive recovery plan.

Key details regarding Vaibhav Sooryavanshi's injury and recovery:
*   **Injury Type:** Grade 2 Hamstring Tear
*   **Incident:** Sustained during a Ranji Trophy match on October 20, 2023
*   **Rehabilitation Location:** National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru
*   **Estimated Recovery Period:** 8-10 weeks
*   **Impact:** Ruled out of upcoming T20I series against South Africa and preparatory national camp

BCCI Honorary Secretary Jay Shah, in a brief statement accompanying the medical update, expressed regret over Sooryavanshi's setback but emphasized the board's commitment to player welfare. "Vaibhav is an exciting young talent, and we are disappointed that he will miss out on potential national opportunities due to this injury," Shah stated. "Our medical team at the NCA will provide him with the best possible care to ensure a full and swift recovery. Player health remains our utmost priority."

Sooryavanshi is expected to report to the NCA in Bengaluru next week to commence his rehabilitation program. This will involve a structured regimen of physiotherapy, strength and conditioning exercises, and gradual reintroduction to cricket-specific training under the supervision of NCA specialists. His progress will be regularly monitored, and a fitness assessment will be conducted before he is cleared to return to competitive cricket. The timeline suggests a potential return to the field in late December or early January, pending his recovery trajectory.
