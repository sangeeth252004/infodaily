Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have made a net investment of Rs 8,129 crore into Indian equity markets during the first nine days of February, marking a significant reversal of a three-month trend of net outflows. This fresh capital infusion, recorded between February 1 and February 9, indicates renewed investor interest following a period of sustained selling activity.

The latest figures, compiled from depository data, show FPIs moving from a net selling position to a net buying one. This development follows substantial outflows from Indian equities in the preceding months. Data indicated FPIs were net sellers in October, November, and December 2023, and continued this trend into January 2024, with a net withdrawal of Rs 25,743 crore from the equity segment. The February inflow, therefore, represents a notable shift in their investment strategy towards India.

Several factors are cited by market analysts as potential contributors to this renewed FPI confidence. A stable global economic outlook and easing inflation concerns in major economies have likely played a role. Domestically, India's robust economic growth projections and strong corporate earnings performance in the December quarter have bolstered investor sentiment. The interim budget, presented on February 1, which emphasized fiscal prudence and continued infrastructure spending, may have also provided an impetus for foreign investors.

The influx of foreign capital is a positive indicator for the Indian stock market, potentially providing support for benchmark indices and reducing volatility. It signals that foreign investors are increasingly viewing India as an attractive destination for capital, driven by its economic resilience and growth potential in a challenging global environment. The investment is primarily concentrated in the equity segment, reflecting a strategic allocation to capitalize on India's growth narrative.

Looking ahead, the sustainability of FPI inflows will be contingent on various factors. Global interest rate trajectories, particularly decisions by central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve, will continue to influence capital flows to emerging markets. Domestically, the trajectory of corporate earnings, inflation control, and the lead-up to the general elections later in the year are key elements that foreign investors will monitor closely. Continued policy stability and economic performance are anticipated to be crucial in maintaining this positive momentum in FPI investments.
