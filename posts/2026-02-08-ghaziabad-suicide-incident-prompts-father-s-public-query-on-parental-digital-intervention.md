A tragic incident in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, saw the suicide of a minor, leading the child's father to make an emotional public statement that has initiated a significant public discourse on parental authority over children's digital devices.

His statement underscores the escalating complexities parents face in managing their children's digital lives and the broader implications for family dynamics and adolescent well-being.

The incident and the father's subsequent public address highlight a critical contemporary challenge for families: balancing children's access to technology with parental oversight and protection. The father's emotional query reflects a poignant moment of introspection, bringing into sharp focus the ethical and potentially legal boundaries of parental intervention in children's digital privacy and device usage.
