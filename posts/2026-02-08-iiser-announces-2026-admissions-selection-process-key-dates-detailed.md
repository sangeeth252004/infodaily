The Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) have officially released the detailed admission criteria and schedule for their five-year BS-MS Dual Degree programs and four-year BS programs for the academic session 2026-27. The announcement, made through the Joint Admission Programme for IISERs (JAP), outlines the various admission channels, eligibility requirements, and crucial timelines for prospective students aiming to pursue integrated science education at one of the seven premier institutions across India.

Admission to IISERs for the 2026-27 academic year will primarily be conducted through three distinct channels: the State and Central Boards (SCB) channel, the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) channel, and the JEE Advanced channel. Each channel caters to different applicant profiles and has specific qualification criteria that must be met by candidates.

The most common pathway, the SCB channel, requires candidates to appear for the IISER Aptitude Test (IAT) 2026. Eligibility for this channel typically mandates applicants to have passed their Class 12 examination in the science stream in either 2024 or 2025, with a minimum aggregate of 60% marks (55% for SC/ST/PwD candidates) from a recognized board. The IAT is designed to assess candidates' aptitude in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biology, with each subject carrying equal weightage in the examination.

For those applying through the KVPY channel, candidates must have secured a KVPY fellowship, awarded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, for the 2025-26 academic year. This channel offers direct admissions based on the fellowship status, bypassing the requirement to appear for the IAT. Similarly, the JEE Advanced channel is open to candidates who have qualified for the JEE Advanced 2026 examination and secured a rank within the specified cutoff declared by IISERs. Admitted students through this channel typically join the BS-MS program.

The seven IISERs currently participating in this joint admission process are located in Berhampur, Bhopal, Kolkata, Mohali, Pune, Thiruvananthapuram, and Tirupati, offering a rigorous curriculum focused on interdisciplinary scientific research and education.

The structured admission process aims to attract bright minds passionate about fundamental sciences, preparing them for careers in research, academia, and various scientific industries. Students are encouraged to prepare thoroughly for the IAT or ensure their eligibility through the KVPY and JEE Advanced channels to secure a coveted spot in these institutions.
