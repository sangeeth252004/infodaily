The practice of instantaneous triple talaq, which permitted Muslim men in India to divorce their wives by uttering the word "talaq" three times, was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India in August 2017. This pivotal ruling effectively abolished the practice, citing its arbitrary and discriminatory nature against Muslim women. The judicial decision subsequently led to the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which formally criminalized the practice nationwide.

The abolition of triple talaq addressed a long-standing demand from various women's rights organizations and numerous Muslim women across India who had experienced the abrupt termination of their marriages. Prior to the Supreme Court's intervention, women could be divorced instantly, often through informal means such as letters, phone calls, or even text messages, without any formal legal process or established recourse. This system frequently left women vulnerable, financially insecure, and without adequate legal protection or provisions for maintenance. The Supreme Court's five-judge bench, in its 3:2 majority verdict, affirmed that the practice violated the fundamental rights of Muslim women as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

The legal prohibition was enacted to foster gender equality and uphold justice within the Muslim community, bringing personal laws into alignment with contemporary constitutional principles. The subsequent 2019 Act established specific legal frameworks to address instances of triple talaq, reinforcing the Supreme Court's judgment with statutory backing.

*   **Supreme Court Verdict (August 22, 2017):** A five-judge constitutional bench, comprising judges from diverse religious backgrounds, declared instantaneous triple talaq unconstitutional. The court cited violations of Articles 14, 15, and 21 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality before law, prohibit discrimination, and protect life and personal liberty, respectively.
*   **Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019:** The Indian Parliament passed this Act to provide legal force to the Supreme Court's judgment. It was initially promulgated as an ordinance on September 19, 2018, before being passed as a full Act.
*   **Criminalization:** The Act designates the pronouncement of instant triple talaq as a cognizable and non-bailable offense, punishable by imprisonment for up to three years and a fine.
*   **Maintenance Provisions:** It further entitles divorced Muslim women to receive a subsistence allowance from their husbands for themselves and any dependent children.
*   **Child Custody:** The Act also includes provisions granting custody of minor children to the mother in such divorce cases.

The enforcement of the 2019 Act marked a significant transformation in legal protections available to Muslim women in India. While the legislation has generated debate concerning its criminal provisions, its primary objective remains to deter the practice of instantaneous triple talaq and uphold the marital rights and dignity of women. The current legal framework ensures that Muslim women cannot be divorced arbitrarily, thereby providing them with established legal avenues for recourse and support. This legislative action is widely regarded as a significant stride towards greater social justice and gender parity within India's intricate legal landscape.
