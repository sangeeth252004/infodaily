Kochi City Police have initiated a comprehensive investigation into an alleged gang-rape incident at a spa located in Kakkanad, following a detailed statement provided by a 24-year-old woman from Malappuram. The survivor lodged a formal complaint on July 18, recounting an ordeal she described as "35 minutes of horror," during which she alleged she was held at knifepoint and subjected to sexual assault.

The incident reportedly unfolded after the survivor was contacted via Instagram with a job offer, which led her to a flat in Kakkanad. According to her statement to the police, she was subsequently taken to a spa in the area where the alleged assault took place. She informed authorities that she was threatened with a knife, filmed during the act, and later blackmailed with demands for Rs 1 lakh. The police have registered a case and are actively pursuing leads.
