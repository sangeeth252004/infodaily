The National Testing Agency (NTA) has announced the commencement of registrations for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate) 2026, commonly known as NEET UG 2026. Aspiring candidates for admission to undergraduate medical and dental courses across India can now access the application forms and detailed information bulletin on the official NTA NEET portal, neet.nta.nic.in. The opening of the registration window marks a critical initial step for students aiming to pursue careers in medicine.

NEET UG serves as the sole entrance examination for admission to MBBS, BDS, and various AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy) courses in government and private institutions nationwide. The examination is crucial for a vast number of students, making its registration period a significant event in the academic calendar. This centralized test aims to streamline admissions and ensure a standardized evaluation process for medical aspirants.

The online application process requires candidates to provide personal, academic, and contact details, alongside uploading necessary documents. Prospective applicants are advised to meticulously review the official Information Bulletin released by the NTA, which contains comprehensive details regarding eligibility criteria, application fees, examination pattern, syllabus, and important dates.

Key details for prospective applicants include:
*   **Application Method:** All applications must be submitted online exclusively through the official website, neet.nta.nic.in.
*   **Application Window:** The registration portal is currently active. Candidates must adhere to the specified deadline for form submission, which will be detailed in the official bulletin.
*   **Fees:** Application fees vary based on the candidate's category, with specific amounts outlined in the information bulletin. Payment can typically be made online via debit card, credit card, net banking, or UPI.

Eligibility criteria for NEET UG 2026 are stringent and must be met by all applicants. These typically include:
*   **Age Limit:** Candidates must have completed 17 years of age by December 31, 2026. There is no upper age limit for NEET UG as per current regulations.
*   **Educational Qualification:** Applicants must have passed 10+2 or an equivalent examination with Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Biotechnology, and English as core subjects from a recognized board.
*   **Minimum Marks:** General category candidates generally require a minimum aggregate of 50% marks in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology/Biotechnology. Relaxations are provided for candidates from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC-NCL), and Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD), who typically require 40% and 45% respectively.

Essential documents required during the online application process usually include:
*   A recent passport-sized photograph.
*   Candidate's signature.
*   Left-hand thumb impression.
*   Relevant category certificates (if applicable).
*   PwBD certificate (if applicable).

Candidates are strongly urged to cross-verify all entered information before final submission, as corrections windows are typically limited. Following the registration period, the NTA will announce dates for admit card downloads, examination city allocations, and ultimately, the examination date for NEET UG 2026. Consistent monitoring of the official NTA website for real-time updates and notifications is recommended for all registered candidates.
