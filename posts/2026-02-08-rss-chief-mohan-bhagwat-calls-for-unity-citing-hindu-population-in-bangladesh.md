Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat recently highlighted the presence of an estimated 1.25 crore (12.5 million) Hindus residing in Bangladesh during a public address in Nagpur, India. This statement was made in conjunction with a call for unity, emphasizing the importance of consolidating Hindu identity and influence. The remarks by the head of India's prominent Hindu nationalist organization underscore ongoing discussions regarding religious minorities in neighboring countries and the broader agenda of Hindu solidarity.

Bhagwat's comments bring attention to the demographic composition of Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim nation that shares a long border with India. The figure of 1.25 crore Hindus represents a significant minority population within Bangladesh. Historically, the Hindu population in what is now Bangladesh has experienced demographic shifts, particularly following the partition of British India in 1947 and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, which led to significant migrations and changes in communal ratios.

The RSS, a voluntary Hindu nationalist organization founded in 1925, advocates for the concept of Hindutva, promoting Hindu values and cultural identity. As its Sarsanghchalak (chief), Mohan Bhagwat's pronouncements often carry significant weight within India's political and social landscape, influencing dialogue on national identity, cultural preservation, and regional geopolitics. His "unity call" is typically interpreted within the RSS framework as an appeal for greater cohesion and strength among the global Hindu community, aimed at fostering a unified Hindu society.

During his address, Bhagwat reiterated the RSS's long-standing focus on strengthening Hindu society, both within India and among diasporic communities. The reference to the Hindu population in Bangladesh serves to highlight the organization's broader perspective on the Hindu presence beyond India's borders and its concern for these communities. Such statements from the RSS chief frequently contribute to national discourse on cultural identity, minority rights, and India's relationship with its neighbors.

Key details related to the statement include:

*   **Speaker:** Mohan Bhagwat, the sixth Sarsanghchalak (chief) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) since 2009.
*   **Organization:** The RSS is a right-wing Hindu paramilitary volunteer organization in India, established in 1925. It is recognized as the ideological parent organization of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
*   **Demographic Context:** According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) 2022 census, Hindus constitute approximately 7.95% of Bangladesh's total population. The figure of 1.25 crore (12.5 million) aligns with recent census data for the Hindu population in Bangladesh.
*   **Unity Call:** The "unity call" aligns with the RSS's core ideology of Hindutva, which seeks to consolidate Hindus globally and promote a unified Hindu identity.

Bhagwat's statements are expected to be interpreted in various ways, ranging from calls for cultural and religious solidarity to broader geopolitical implications concerning regional minority populations. The emphasis on Hindu unity and the specific mention of the community in Bangladesh underline the RSS's continued focus on demographic trends and its vision for a globally strong Hindu identity. Further discussions on these topics are anticipated within political and social circles in India and potentially in Bangladesh.
