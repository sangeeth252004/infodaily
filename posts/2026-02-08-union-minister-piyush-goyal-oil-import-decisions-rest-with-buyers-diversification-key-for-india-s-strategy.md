NEW DELHI – India's Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, stated in August 2022 that decisions regarding oil imports are exclusively determined by the purchasing entities, not dictated by international trade agreements. The Minister underscored the critical importance of diversifying India's energy import sources, citing it as a strategic national interest vital for enhancing energy security and ensuring stable supplies for consumers.

Mr. Goyal's remarks came amidst ongoing discussions surrounding India's trade policies and its approach to securing essential commodities like crude oil in a volatile global market. He clarified that free trade agreements (FTAs), such as the one recently signed with the United Arab Emirates or others under negotiation, do not include specific clauses mandating energy sourcing from particular nations. Instead, he emphasized that Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs) operate on commercial principles, making procurement decisions based on factors such as price competitiveness, reliability of supply, logistical efficiency, and crude oil grades suitable for domestic refineries.

The Minister reiterated that India, as a major global energy consumer, has a strategic imperative to expand its energy procurement footprint. Diversification reduces dependency on any single geographical region or supplier, thereby mitigating risks associated with geopolitical instabilities, supply disruptions, and price volatility. This approach aims to safeguard India's economic stability and ensure consistent energy access for its vast population and growing industrial sector.

Key details regarding India's energy import strategy include:

*   **High Import Dependency:** India imports over 80% of its crude oil requirements, making it highly susceptible to international price fluctuations and global supply chain dynamics.
*   **Commercial Decisions:** Both state-owned and private Indian OMCs regularly engage with suppliers globally, assessing bids and making purchases based on optimal commercial terms rather than political directives within trade agreements.
*   **Geopolitical Context:** The emphasis on diversification gained particular relevance in the context of shifting global energy landscapes and geopolitical developments impacting traditional supply routes and pricing mechanisms.
*   **Consumer Impact:** The government's stated strategy focuses on ensuring affordable and stable energy prices for Indian consumers and businesses, thereby minimizing inflationary pressures and supporting economic growth.

Looking ahead, India is expected to continue pursuing a pragmatic and commercially driven approach to its energy imports. The government's stated policy prioritizes securing energy at competitive prices from a multitude of global sources, further strengthening the nation's energy resilience. This sustained focus on diversification is anticipated to remain a cornerstone of India's long-term energy security strategy.
