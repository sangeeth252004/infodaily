Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway has issued a public apology for her past contacts with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The apology came during an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK, where the royal addressed public scrutiny surrounding her association with Epstein.

The Crown Princess stated she met Epstein "several times" between 2000 and 2004, through mutual acquaintances. These initial meetings took place before Epstein's first conviction in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor. She described her interactions during that period as "naive" and expressed regret for not having investigated his background more thoroughly at the time.

Following Epstein's 2008 conviction, Crown Princess Mette-Marit acknowledged that she maintained some brief contact with him, an action she now deeply regrets. She confirmed that she definitively broke off all communication with Epstein in 2012. Epstein later died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on new sex trafficking charges.

*   **Timeline of Contacts:**
    *   **2000-2004:** Initial meetings occurred through mutual acquaintances, prior to Epstein's first conviction.
    *   **2008:** Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor.
    *   **Post-2008:** Crown Princess Mette-Marit maintained brief, regrettable contact after his conviction.
    *   **2012:** All contact was definitively ceased.

The revelation and subsequent apology have intensified public scrutiny of the Norwegian royal house. This scrutiny echoes past periods of intense public and media attention on Crown Princess Mette-Marit, who married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001. As a commoner, a single mother, and with a publicly acknowledged "wild past" prior to her marriage, her background led to what the Norwegian press at the time termed a "wife hunt," describing the extensive scrutiny she faced. This historical context highlights the consistent public interest and expectations placed upon members of the royal family regarding their associations and conduct.

The Royal House has not issued a separate statement beyond the Crown Princess's interview. The apology aims to address public concern and uphold the integrity of the monarchy in light of the renewed focus on Epstein's connections following his death and ongoing global investigations into his network. The Crown Princess indicated her hope that by openly addressing the issue, the matter can be put behind them.
