YEREVAN, ARMENIA – Armenia has publicly displayed Indian-manufactured Akash surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems and Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher (MBRL) systems, with video footage of the equipment circulating on social media platforms. This development marks a notable step in Armenia's ongoing efforts to modernize its armed forces and diversify its defense procurement, highlighting strengthening military-technical cooperation with India.

The appearance of these advanced Indian defense systems underscores a strategic shift in Armenia's defense architecture. Historically reliant on Russian military equipment, Armenia has increasingly sought alternative suppliers following recent geopolitical challenges and security concerns, particularly in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. This diversification aims to bolster the nation's defensive capabilities against potential threats.

The acquisition of the Akash SAM system enhances Armenia's air defense capabilities. Developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Akash is a medium-range, all-weather, supersonic missile system engineered to intercept aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, and drones. It possesses an operational range of approximately 25 kilometers, providing a crucial layer of protection against aerial targets. The deal for the Akash system was reportedly finalized in 2023.

Complementing its air defense, Armenia has also showcased the Pinaka MBRL system, another indigenous Indian development. The Pinaka is a robust multi-barrel rocket launcher system capable of firing a salvo of 12 rockets in 44 seconds, providing rapid, high-volume fire support. It is available in both guided and unguided variants, with ranges extending up to 75 kilometers, offering significant long-range artillery capabilities. A deal for the Pinaka systems, valued at approximately $250 million, was concluded in 2022.

This strategic procurement drive aligns with Armenia's heightened focus on national security. The country's defense budget saw a significant increase of 46% for 2023, reflecting a commitment to upgrade its military infrastructure and improve operational readiness. India has emerged as a key alternative arms supplier for Armenia, reportedly providing a range of systems beyond the Akash and Pinaka, including anti-tank missiles, as reported in 2023.

Key details of the acquired systems include:
*   **Akash SAM System:**
    *   Type: Medium-range, surface-to-air missile system.
    *   Developer: Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), India.
    *   Capability: Designed to intercept aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, and drones.
    *   Range: Approximately 25 kilometers.
    *   Features: All-weather, supersonic missile system.
*   **Pinaka MBRL System:**

The display of these Indian defense systems signifies the operational integration of new assets into Armenia's military. This ongoing modernization is expected to continue as Armenia seeks to fortify its defense posture and adapt to evolving regional security dynamics, while deepening its defense industrial ties with India. Further military-technical cooperation between the two nations could consolidate this emerging strategic partnership.
