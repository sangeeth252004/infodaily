The Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) has officially announced the release of marks for the Tier-I examination conducted for the recruitment of Account Assistant cum Cashier (Post Code 96/20). Concurrently, the Board has commenced the process of inviting e-dossiers from candidates who have been provisionally shortlisted based on their performance in the Tier-I examination. This development signals a crucial phase in the selection procedure for these administrative positions, which are intended to be filled across various departments under the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD).

The Tier-I examination, an objective-type multiple-choice test, was previously conducted on various dates for the aforementioned post. Candidates who appeared for this examination can now access their individual marks by logging into the DSSSB's official online portal. Access requires the candidate's application number and date of birth. In addition to individual scores, the Board has also made public the category-wise cut-off marks, which serve as the qualifying threshold for provisional shortlisting to the subsequent stages of the recruitment process. The release of these marks allows candidates to ascertain their standing and eligibility for progression.

The e-dossier submission stage is a mandatory requirement for all provisionally shortlisted candidates. This digital process necessitates applicants to upload scanned copies of all requisite documents, including but not limited to educational qualifications, experience certificates (if applicable), caste certificates (for reserved categories), and disability certificates (for Persons with Benchmark Disabilities). The primary objective of this stage is to facilitate the verification of claims made by candidates in their initial application forms and to ensure their eligibility aligns with the detailed advertisement. Failure to submit the e-dossier within the stipulated timeframe will result in the automatic cancellation of candidature.

Key details regarding the e-dossier submission process are as follows:

*   **Submission Period:** The online portal for e-dossier submission has been activated by the DSSSB. Provisionally shortlisted candidates must submit their documents within a specified window, typically spanning several weeks. Specific start and end dates for this period are available on the official DSSSB notification. Candidates are advised to complete the submission process well ahead of the deadline to mitigate any potential technical difficulties.
*   **Accessing the Portal:** Shortlisted candidates are required to log in to the DSSSB's Online Application Registration System (OARS) portal using their unique application number and password. A dedicated link for e-dossier submission is made available on the dashboard for eligible candidates.
*   **Documents Required:** Commonly requested documents for verification include:
    *   Matriculation/10th Class Certificate (for proof of Date of Birth).
    *   Relevant Educational Degree/Diploma Certificates and Marksheets (as per the specific requirements of the Account Assistant cum Cashier post).
    *   Experience Certificates (if the post requires specific work experience).
    *   Category Certificates (SC/ST/OBC/EWS) issued by the competent authority, conforming to the prescribed format.
    *   Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) Certificate, if applicable.
    *   A copy of the Tier-I Examination Admit Card.
    *   Recent photographs and signature, adhering to specified guidelines.

Upon the successful completion of the e-dossier submission and subsequent verification of all uploaded documents, the DSSSB will proceed to compile a final merit list for the Account Assistant cum Cashier posts. The ultimate selection will be determined based on the candidates' performance in the Tier-I examination, contingent upon the successful verification of all submitted credentials. Candidates are strongly urged to regularly monitor the official DSSSB website (dsssb.delhi.gov.in) for the latest updates, important announcements, and any further instructions pertinent to this ongoing recruitment drive. The Board emphasizes that its decisions concerning eligibility and final selection will be conclusive.
