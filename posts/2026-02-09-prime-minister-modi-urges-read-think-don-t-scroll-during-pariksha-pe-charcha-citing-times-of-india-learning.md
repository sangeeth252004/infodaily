Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the fifth edition of the annual "Pariksha Pe Charcha" event in January 2022, urged students to adopt a "read, think, don't scroll" approach to consuming information. Speaking to a large audience of students, parents, and teachers, the Prime Minister shared a personal anecdote, recalling how he developed his understanding of current affairs by meticulously reading The Times of India in his youth. His advice aimed to encourage deeper engagement with content rather than passive digital consumption.

The "Pariksha Pe Charcha" initiative is an annual interactive session led by Prime Minister Modi, designed to address student anxieties regarding examinations, academic pressures, and life skills. The 2022 session, held at the Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi, provided a platform for students from across India to engage directly with the Prime Minister on various topics, including effective study methods, stress management, and maintaining focus in the digital age.

During the interaction, Prime Minister Modi highlighted the distinction between actively processing information and merely scanning content on digital platforms. He advised students to cultivate habits that promote critical thinking and retention. "When you scroll, you are just seeing things. When you read, you grasp things," he stated, emphasizing the importance of dedicated engagement with written material. He elaborated on his personal method, recounting how he would cut out articles from The Times of India, create notes from them, and review them later to solidify his learning. This practice, he noted, significantly contributed to his knowledge acquisition and analytical skills.

*   **Event Date:** The fifth edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha took place in January 2022.
*   **Key Message:** "Read, think, don't scroll," promoting active learning over passive digital consumption.
*   **Personal Anecdote:** Prime Minister Modi recalled cutting articles from The Times of India, making notes, and reviewing them for in-depth learning.
*   **Target Audience:** Students, parents, and teachers across India, participating both in-person and virtually.

The Prime Minister’s remarks underscored the enduring value of traditional reading habits and the importance of media literacy in an increasingly digital world. His counsel encouraged students to evaluate information critically, fostering a mindset of deeper inquiry rather than superficial engagement. This perspective becomes particularly relevant as young individuals navigate a vast landscape of online content, requiring discerning skills to separate informative material from distractions. The Pariksha Pe Charcha platform continues to serve as an important forum for such guidance, aiming to equip students with strategies for both academic success and holistic personal development.
