On Friday, the Supreme Court of India rejected the interim bail plea filed by former BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar, who was convicted in the 2017 Unnao rape case. The apex court concurrently directed the Delhi High Court to conduct an "out of turn" hearing for Sengar's appeal against his conviction, emphasizing the need for an expedited resolution.

Sengar, currently serving a life sentence, had sought interim bail from February 1 to March 3, 2024, citing his daughter's wedding, scheduled for the last week of February. A bench comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Sandeep Mehta heard the plea. Representing Sengar, Additional Solicitor General K.M. Nataraj presented the urgency for the interim bail. However, the Supreme Court determined that granting bail was unnecessary given its directive to the Delhi High Court to hear the main appeal against conviction as expeditiously as possible.

The court's decision underscores a judicial emphasis on resolving long-pending appeals while balancing individual circumstances. The bench's directive mandates the Delhi High Court to prioritize Sengar's appeal, potentially leading to a quicker determination of his legal challenge against the conviction.

Kuldeep Sengar was convicted by a Delhi trial court in December 2019 under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He was found guilty of raping a minor girl in 2017 in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh. The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 25 lakh. The case had garnered significant national attention and was transferred to Delhi from Uttar Pradesh on orders from the Supreme Court to ensure a fair trial.

Earlier, in November 2023, the Delhi High Court had granted Sengar conditional interim bail for a period of 15 days, from November 27 to December 11, specifically for his daughter's engagement and associated ceremonies. This previous grant of conditional bail was also linked to family functions.

With the Supreme Court's rejection of the latest bail application, the legal focus now shifts entirely to the Delhi High Court. The High Court is expected to prioritize and schedule the hearing of Sengar's appeal against his conviction, which challenges the lower court's judgment. Sengar will remain in judicial custody pending the outcome of this expedited appellate process. The directive aims to bring a conclusive legal resolution to the long-running case in a more timely manner.
