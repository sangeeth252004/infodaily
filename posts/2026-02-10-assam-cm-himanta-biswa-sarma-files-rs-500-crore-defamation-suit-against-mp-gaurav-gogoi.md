Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has filed a civil defamation suit of Rs 500 crore (5,00,00,00,000 INR) against Congress Member of Parliament Gaurav Gogoi. The suit was lodged in the Kamrup Civil Court in Guwahati on October 18, 2022, in response to what the Chief Minister's legal representatives have termed "defamatory and unsubstantiated allegations" made by Mr. Gogoi concerning a land acquisition deal.

The legal action follows a series of public statements and social media posts by Mr. Gogoi. These allegations primarily focused on claims that RBS Realtors, a company associated with Mr. Sarma's wife, Riniki Bhuyan Sarma, acquired agricultural land in 2020. Mr. Gogoi had asserted that this land was originally designated for landless indigenous people and that its acquisition during the COVID-19 pandemic raised questions of impropriety and ethical conduct.

Chief Minister Sarma has consistently and publicly denied these allegations, branding them as baseless attempts to damage his and his family's reputation. Through his legal counsel, the Chief Minister stated that the lawsuit seeks to address the significant harm caused by what he considers false statements and their implications. The suit underscores the assertion that the allegations have caused substantial damage to the Chief Minister's public image and personal integrity, necessitating a firm legal response. Mr. Sarma has maintained that all transactions involving his family are transparent and conducted within legal frameworks.

In response to the defamation suit, Mr. Gogoi has publicly indicated his readiness to contest the case. Representatives for Mr. Gogoi have stated that they stand by the claims made and intend to present their defense in court during the proceedings. This high-value defamation case highlights a growing trend among political leaders in India to seek legal redress against opponents for alleged slander, thereby escalating the intensity of political discourse beyond public platforms into judicial arenas. The proceedings are anticipated to attract considerable media and public scrutiny, given the prominent political stature of both individuals involved.

Key details of the defamation suit include:
*   **Plaintiff:** Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma
*   **Defendant:** Congress Member of Parliament Gaurav Gogoi
*   **Claim Amount:** Rs 500 crore (5,00,00,00,000 INR)
*   **Court:** Kamrup Civil Court, Guwahati
*   **Date Filed:** October 18, 2022
*   **Basis of Suit:** Alleged defamatory remarks by Mr. Gogoi concerning a land deal involving CM Sarma's family.
*   **Specific Allegation:** Acquisition of agricultural land by RBS Realtors, a company linked to CM Sarma's wife, Riniki Bhuyan Sarma, during the 2020 pandemic, land reportedly designated for landless indigenous people.

The Kamrup Civil Court is expected to proceed with the examination of the defamation suit as per standard judicial procedures. Both the Chief Minister's legal team and Mr. Gogoi's counsel are preparing their respective arguments and evidence. The outcome of this case could establish important precedents regarding how political accusations are legally addressed in India. The progress of this litigation will be closely monitored by political analysts, legal observers, and media outlets alike as it unfolds in the public domain.
