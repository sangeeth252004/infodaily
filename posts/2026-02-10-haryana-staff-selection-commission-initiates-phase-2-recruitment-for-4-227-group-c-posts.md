This phase aims to fill 4,227 Group C government positions across various departments in Haryana. The announcement, made by the commission, marks a significant step in the state's ongoing efforts to streamline public sector hiring and address workforce requirements.

The current recruitment cycle, designated as HSSC CET Phase 2 for the 2026 intake, invites applications from candidates who have successfully qualified in the initial CET Phase 1 examination. The HSSC has specified that only those candidates meeting the stipulated eligibility criteria and possessing valid scores from the previous phase are eligible to apply for these specialized Group C roles. The drive is crucial for strengthening the administrative and operational capabilities of numerous government departments within Haryana.

Group C posts typically encompass a wide range of roles, including clerks, data entry operators, various technical assistants, and other support staff. These positions are essential for the smooth functioning of public services and the efficient delivery of government schemes across the state. The substantial number of vacancies indicates a significant push to bolster the state's public administration.

Key details regarding the HSSC CET Phase 2 recruitment include:

The final merit list will be prepared based on scores obtained in CET Phase 1 and performance in the subsequent stages.
