NEW DELHI – The Indian government recently informed a parliamentary standing committee that it would maintain its long-standing policy of procuring crude oil from sources offering the most competitive prices and best quality available globally. This reaffirmation by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas comes amidst significant geopolitical shifts and volatility impacting international energy markets.

As the world's third-largest consumer and importer of crude oil, India relies heavily on foreign sources, with over 85% of its crude oil needs met through imports. The government's reiterated policy underscores a critical focus on national energy security, mitigating inflationary pressures, and ensuring economic stability for its vast population and growing industrial sector.

The government's stance highlights a pragmatic approach to energy procurement, prioritizing the nation's economic interests. This strategy has notably led to India increasing its crude oil imports from Russia. These imports commenced at significantly higher volumes after Western nations imposed sanctions on Moscow following the conflict in Ukraine, prompting Russia to offer discounted prices to alternative buyers. Prior to this period, Russian crude constituted less than 1% of India's total crude oil imports.

Official submissions to the parliamentary panel reportedly emphasized that India's public sector undertakings (PSUs) involved in oil procurement are directed to maximize value for the nation. This directive includes identifying optimal crude sources and logistical arrangements that result in lower costs, ultimately benefiting domestic consumers and industries. The policy is presented not as a new initiative but as a consistent, fundamental approach to managing a critical national resource.

The global crude oil market has experienced unprecedented fluctuations, with prices soaring earlier in 2022 before some moderation. India's strategy aims to insulate its domestic market from the full impact of these price swings, which directly influence the cost of petrol, diesel, and other petroleum products essential for transport and manufacturing.

Key aspects of India’s crude oil procurement strategy include:
*   **High Import Dependency:** India imports over 85% of its crude oil requirements.
*   **Diversified Sourcing:** Historically, major suppliers include Iraq, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and the USA. The strategy allows for flexibility to tap into new markets offering advantageous terms.
*   **Economic Imperative:** The primary objective is to secure a stable and affordable energy supply to fuel a rapidly growing economy.
*   **Market Responsiveness:** The government monitors global price movements and geopolitical developments to adjust procurement decisions.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is expected to continue its close monitoring of global energy markets, adapting procurement strategies as international conditions and supply dynamics evolve. The government remains committed to diversifying its energy basket while upholding its core principle of securing crude oil at the most competitive global rates to support sustained national economic growth and stability.
