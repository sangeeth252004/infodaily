In August 2022, a notice for a no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla was circulated among various opposition Members of Parliament (MPs). While several opposition leaders and MPs endorsed the document with their signatures, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was notably not among those who signed the notice. This development occurred during a parliamentary session marked by extensive debate and disruptions over key national issues.

The consideration of a no-confidence motion directed at the Speaker is a significant parliamentary action, distinct from a similar motion against the Council of Ministers. Under the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, such a motion typically requires the support of at least 50 Lok Sabha MPs to be admitted for discussion by the House. Its purpose is to formally express a lack of confidence in the Speaker's conduct of the House's proceedings or impartiality.

Sources within the Indian National Congress party clarified Rahul Gandhi's non-signature, stating it was a procedural decision rather than an indication of dissent or lack of support for the opposition's collective stance. It was reported that the necessary threshold of 50 signatures had already been secured by other opposition MPs, rendering additional signatures, including that of Mr. Gandhi, procedurally unnecessary for the motion's admission. Party insiders indicated that strategic considerations often guide which leaders sign such notices, particularly when the required numbers are met without their direct involvement in the initial signing process.

The notice against Speaker Birla emerged during a period of heightened parliamentary tension. Both Houses of Parliament had experienced repeated adjournments and stalemates, primarily over opposition demands for discussions on topics such as rising inflation, unemployment, and the Agnipath military recruitment scheme. Opposition parties had frequently accused the government and the Speaker of not allowing adequate time for debate on these pressing issues.

Key procedural details regarding the notice include:
*   **Target:** Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.
*   **Requirement:** Minimum of 50 Lok Sabha MPs' signatures to admit the motion.
*   **Context:** Persistent parliamentary disruptions and opposition demands for debate on national issues.
*   **Reported Rationale for Non-Signature:** Procedural; sufficient signatures were already obtained.

Ultimately, the specific no-confidence notice against Speaker Om Birla did not proceed to a vote in the Lok Sabha. The episode highlighted the various tactical approaches employed by opposition parties to exert pressure and raise concerns within the established parliamentary framework, even as specific procedural decisions, such as Mr. Gandhi's non-signature, drew particular attention to the dynamics within the opposition coalition.
