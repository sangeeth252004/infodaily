MOGADISHU, SOMALIA – A commercial aircraft carrying 55 individuals crashed on Tuesday, December 17, 2024, shortly after departing from Aden Adde International Airport in Mogadishu, Somalia. All 52 passengers and three crew members aboard the Jubba Airways Fokker 50 aircraft survived the incident, which saw the plane break apart after veering off the runway.

The incident occurred as the aircraft, identified as flight 189, was attempting to take off for a domestic flight within Somalia. Reports from the scene indicate the plane veered sharply to the right of the runway before crashing and coming to rest beyond the airport perimeter. Visual evidence, including photographs shared by local media and officials, depicted the aircraft’s fuselage separated into multiple sections, with significant structural damage to the wings and tail. Despite the severe impact, the emergency response by airport and local authorities was swift.

Airport fire and rescue teams, alongside local security forces, were immediately deployed to the crash site. Their rapid intervention facilitated the prompt evacuation of all occupants. Officials confirmed that while several individuals received medical attention for minor injuries, there were no fatalities. The successful evacuation and survival of all on board represent a notable outcome in what appeared to be a high-severity aviation incident.

Abdirahman K. Omar, the Director of Somalia's Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA), confirmed the event and the full survival rate. He praised the coordinated efforts of emergency services and announced that a comprehensive investigation has been initiated to determine the precise cause of the crash. The aircraft was scheduled to fly from Mogadishu to Bardere in the Gedo region before continuing to Hargeisa.
