Prime Minister Narendra Modi encouraged students to cultivate habits of focused reading and critical thinking over superficial digital engagement during the 2022 edition of "Pariksha Pe Charcha." The Prime Minister, in an interaction held on April 1, 2022, shared a personal anecdote, recalling his own formative experiences learning from The Times of India newspaper to broaden his knowledge base. His remarks were widely reported, including by The Times of India on August 26, 2022, underscoring the importance of deliberate information consumption.

The Prime Minister's advice, encapsulated in the phrase "Read, think, don't scroll," was delivered as part of his annual dialogue with students, parents, and teachers aimed at mitigating exam stress and fostering effective learning strategies. The session, conducted from Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi, saw PM Modi address a range of student queries concerning academic pressure, career choices, and mental well-being. His emphasis on thoughtful reading contrasted with the prevalent culture of rapid, often disengaged, digital content consumption.

During the discussion, Prime Minister Modi recounted his youth, stating that reading The Times of India provided him with significant general knowledge. He highlighted how engaging with a newspaper offered a structured and comprehensive overview of national and international affairs, contributing to a deeper understanding that casual online browsing often lacks. This personal example served to illustrate the enduring value of traditional print media in developing a well-rounded perspective.

*   **Context of Pariksha Pe Charcha:** An annual initiative by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, where PM Modi interacts directly with students, parents, and teachers to discuss exam-related stress and promote holistic development.
*   **Core Message:** Prioritizing deep reading and critical analysis over passive digital scrolling.
*   **Personal Anecdote:** PM Modi shared that reading The Times of India during his younger days significantly enhanced his general knowledge.
*   **Target Audience:** Students preparing for board examinations and competitive tests, as well as their educators and guardians.

The Prime Minister’s call for a return to more intentional reading habits aligns with broader discussions globally regarding digital literacy, attention spans, and the impact of screen time on cognitive development. By advocating for deeper engagement with content, PM Modi reinforced the idea that true learning stems from thoughtful consideration rather than quick, transient interactions with information. His advice serves as a notable intervention in the ongoing conversation about balancing the benefits of digital technology with the necessity of sustained intellectual engagement. These statements are expected to continue influencing dialogue among educators, parents, and students regarding healthy media consumption and effective study practices.
