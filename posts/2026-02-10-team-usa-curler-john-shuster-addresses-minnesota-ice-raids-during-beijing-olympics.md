During the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Team USA curler and Olympic gold medalist John Shuster publicly criticized reported Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations occurring in his home state of Minnesota. Shuster's statement, made via social media from the Olympic village, highlighted ongoing concerns regarding federal immigration enforcement actions.

Shuster, a prominent figure in American curling who led his team to a gold medal at the 2018 PyeongChang Games, utilized his international platform to voice opposition to the reported raids. His remarks underscore a trend of athletes engaging in social and political commentary while representing their countries. In an Instagram post, Shuster conveyed strong disapproval of the situation, writing, "This is wrong. This is happening in my home state. This is disgusting." He further tagged both ICE and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in his message, urging his followers to "do what you can to help families in need." The timing of his statement, made while representing the United States on an international stage, drew considerable public attention to the issue.

The operations referenced by Shuster were reported by immigrant advocacy groups and local media outlets across Minnesota. These reports described a series of ICE activities, particularly concentrated in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes Minneapolis and St. Paul.
*   Reports indicated that the enforcement actions primarily targeted individuals with prior deportation orders or criminal convictions.
*   Advocacy organizations documented instances of arrests and detentions resulting from these operations.
*   The specific details of the raids, including the exact number of individuals apprehended or the precise dates of all operations, were subject to ongoing monitoring and reports from local community organizations at the time.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains that it conducts targeted enforcement operations regularly throughout the United States to uphold immigration laws. According to the agency, these operations prioritize individuals deemed a threat to national security, public safety, or border security, and are carried out "regardless of nationality." Shuster's public commentary contributed to a broader national discourse surrounding immigration policy and enforcement practices, reflecting diverse perspectives on the issue. Athlete activism, where sports figures leverage their visibility to address societal concerns, has become an increasingly common feature in public life.

As of the immediate aftermath of Shuster's statement, there were no official responses directly from ICE or USCIS specifically addressing his comments. The operations continued to be a point of discussion among advocacy groups and local communities in Minnesota. Shuster continued his participation in the Olympic curling events following his post, without making further public statements on the matter during the Games. The incident highlighted the intersection of global sporting events with domestic social issues and the power of individual voices on a global stage.
