Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath declared in August 2022 that the "Babri structure will never come back," a statement made while cautioning "dreamers" during public addresses in Gorakhpur and Lucknow. The Chief Minister's remarks reinforced the finality of the ongoing construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, a project central to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s agenda. His comments underscored the state government's position on the resolved Ayodhya dispute, emphasizing that the legal and physical landscape of the site has been definitively altered.

The statement by Chief Minister Adityanath directly references the historical Ayodhya land dispute, a contentious issue that has spanned decades in India. The dispute centered on a 2.77-acre site in Ayodhya, which was revered by Hindus as the birthplace of Lord Ram and where the 16th-century Babri Masjid stood until its demolition on December 6, 1992. This event led to widespread communal unrest across the country and remained a highly sensitive matter, prompting extensive legal battles.

The resolution to the dispute came with a landmark verdict by the Supreme Court of India on November 9, 2019. The five-judge constitutional bench unanimously ruled that the disputed land should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Ram Temple. Simultaneously, the court directed the central government to allot a separate five-acre plot of land within Ayodhya for the construction of a mosque for the Muslim community. This judgment aimed to bring a definitive legal conclusion to one of India's most protracted and emotionally charged legal battles.

Following the Supreme Court's verdict, the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust was established to oversee the temple's construction. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Ram Temple on August 5, 2020. Construction has since progressed significantly, with reports indicating various phases of completion and a projected opening of the temple's ground floor for devotees in early 2024.

Chief Minister Adityanath's comments in August 2022 served to reiterate the government's commitment to the temple project and the finality of the judicial decision. His use of the term "dreamers" was interpreted as a warning to those who might still harbor hopes for a reversal of the current situation or a return to the pre-verdict status quo concerning the Ayodhya site. The remarks align with the BJP's long-held ideological stance and its consistent advocacy for the construction of the Ram Temple at the disputed site.

The ongoing construction of the Ram Temple is presented as an irreversible outcome of this resolution, reinforcing the government's narrative surrounding the historical dispute and its conclusion.
