Deepak Nautiyal, a 35-year-old gym owner in Ramnagar, Uttarakhand, has reported a severe decline in his business membership and income after legally changing his name to Mohammad Deepak approximately three months prior to December 2023. His fitness establishment, 'Body Power Fitness Zone', which once served 150 members, now operates with only 12, according to statements made by Nautiyal.

The significant drop in membership has led to a drastic reduction in the gym's monthly revenue. Nautiyal stated his income has fallen from an average of Rs 30,000 to between Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,000, impacting his ability to sustain the business and support his family.

Nautiyal, who married his wife five years ago, made the decision to change his name to Mohammad Deepak, citing a desire for a peaceful life. This personal decision, however, appears to have resulted in considerable professional and social repercussions within his local community in Ramnagar, Nainital district.

Key details surrounding the situation include:
*   **Business Impact:** The gym, 'Body Power Fitness Zone', experienced a decline from 150 members to 12.
*   **Financial Impact:** Monthly income reportedly fell from Rs 30,000 to Rs 4,000-5,000.
*   **Social Repercussions:** Nautiyal stated facing a social boycott from segments of the community, with some former associates ceasing communication.
*   **Threats and Security:** He reported receiving threats, leading to a period of short-term police security.

The challenges faced by Nautiyal highlight the potential social and economic consequences an individual may encounter following personal decisions, particularly those involving identity and religious affiliation within specific community contexts. Nautiyal has indicated that he is now considering reverting to his original name, Deepak Nautiyal, in an effort to mitigate the ongoing difficulties and revive his struggling business. The long-term implications for his gym and personal livelihood remain to be seen as he navigates these circumstances.
