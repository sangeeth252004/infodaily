New Delhi – The Offer For Sale (OFS) of shares in public sector engineering major Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) saw substantial demand from institutional investors on its inaugural day, with bids collectively surpassing Rs 5,600 crore. The government's stake sale, initiated as part of its disinvestment programme, was fully subscribed on Thursday, underscoring strong market confidence in the state-owned enterprise.

The robust interest from institutional buyers marks a significant development for the government's efforts to raise capital through divestment from public sector undertakings (PSUs). The OFS provided an opportunity for the government to offload a portion of its equity in BHEL, a key player in India's power and infrastructure sectors. The oversubscription on the first day, typically reserved for non-retail investors, indicates a healthy appetite among domestic and international institutional funds.

Details of the Offer For Sale indicated a base offer size, with a provision for a greenshoe option to accommodate additional demand. While the exact percentage of stake offered and the floor price were disclosed by the government, the total value of bids received on Day 1 significantly exceeded the initial offer size for institutional participants. This strong showing is often viewed as a positive indicator for the subsequent retail portion of the OFS.

Key aspects of the BHEL OFS include:
*   **Seller:** The Government of India, acting through the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM).
*   **Mechanism:** An Offer For Sale (OFS) on the stock exchanges, a common route for government disinvestment.
*   **Investor Categories:** Day one was exclusively for institutional buyers, including foreign institutional investors (FIIs), domestic financial institutions, mutual funds, and insurance companies.
*   **Bid Value:** Institutional bids exceeded Rs 5,600 crore, ensuring full subscription for their allocated portion of the offer.
*   **Objective:** To streamline government holdings in PSUs and contribute to the national exchequer.

The successful oversubscription on the first day demonstrates investor belief in BHEL's long-term prospects and its foundational role in India's industrial landscape. As a major manufacturer of power generation equipment, BHEL is integral to the country's energy infrastructure development. The outcome of the institutional bidding suggests a favourable valuation perception among large investors.

The second day of the OFS is typically reserved for retail investors, who will have the opportunity to place bids for shares at the cut-off price determined by the institutional bidding process, often with a potential discount. The government aims to successfully complete this divestment to further its fiscal objectives and reinforce capital markets. Final allocations and settlement for both institutional and retail segments will follow the completion of the bidding period.
