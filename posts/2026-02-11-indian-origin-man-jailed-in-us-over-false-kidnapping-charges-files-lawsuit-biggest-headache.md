Ankur Mehta, an Indian-origin man who was falsely jailed in the United States over kidnapping charges, has filed a lawsuit seeking damages for his wrongful arrest and detention. The legal action stems from an incident at a Walmart store in Aiken, South Carolina, on July 10, 2022, where Mehta was accused of attempting to kidnap children.

Mehta's lawsuit names Walmart, several of its employees, and the Aiken County Sheriff's Office as defendants. The civil complaint alleges false arrest, unlawful detention, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress, among other claims. Mehta was held for three days following the accusation, a period he described as the "biggest headache of my life," according to reports.

The incident unfolded when Mehta, reportedly holding his own child's hand, was approached by Walmart employees and subsequently arrested by the Aiken County Sheriff's Office deputies based on allegations from a witness. He was booked into the Aiken County Detention Center, where he remained for approximately three days. Initially denied bail, he was later granted it after a review of surveillance footage, which reportedly contradicted the initial accusations.

Key details surrounding the case include:
*   **Incident Date:** July 10, 2022.
*   **Location:** Walmart store, Aiken, South Carolina.
*   **Accusation:** Attempted kidnapping of children.
*   **Detention:** Ankur Mehta was held for three days.
*   **Charges Dropped:** Following review of surveillance footage, prosecutors dropped all charges against Mehta. The footage reportedly showed Mehta holding his own child's hand, not attempting to abduct other children.
*   **Parties Sued:** Walmart, specific Walmart employees involved, and the Aiken County Sheriff's Office.

The false accusation and subsequent incarceration had significant personal and professional repercussions for Mehta. Reports indicate that he lost his job as a result of the arrest and faced substantial financial strain and emotional distress. His reputation was also reportedly damaged by the widely publicized, though unfounded, allegations.

The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for the physical, emotional, and financial hardships Mehta endured. This legal action highlights concerns regarding the protocols for arrests based on witness statements and the subsequent verification processes, particularly in high-stakes situations involving serious accusations.

The lawsuit is currently in its initial stages, and the involved parties are expected to respond to the allegations in court. The legal proceedings will determine the accountability of the defendants and could potentially lead to policy reviews regarding similar incidents in the future. Further updates are anticipated as the case progresses through the judicial system.
