A senior official of the Indian Air Force (IAF) has clarified the nature of "Op Sindoor," stating that the operation specifically targeted terror and military installations, not a nuclear facility in Pakistan's Kirana Hills. The Vice Air Chief made the assertion, aiming to set the record straight regarding previous speculations about the operation's objectives.

The statement by the Vice Air Chief directly addresses long-standing discussions and reports surrounding "Op Sindoor." According to the official, the operation’s intent and execution were focused on strategic military targets associated with terrorism, deliberately avoiding any nuclear infrastructure within the Kirana Hills region. This distinction is critical in managing regional tensions and clarifying the scope of India's military actions.

The Kirana Hills area in Pakistan has, at times, been a subject of international attention due to its perceived strategic importance. The Vice Air Chief's clarification aims to dispel any notion that India’s military operations would encompass targets with the potential for widespread, destabilizing consequences, such as nuclear sites. The emphasis was placed on precise targeting against terror-related assets, aligning with India's stated counter-terrorism policies.

Key aspects of the Vice Air Chief's statement include:
*   **Target Clarification:** Explicit denial of striking any nuclear sites in Kirana Hills.
*   **Actual Targets:** Confirmation that operations were directed at terror and military targets.
*   **Strategic Intent:** Reinforcement of India's commitment to counter-terrorism without escalating to nuclear confrontation.

This official clarification serves to underscore India's operational doctrine, which reportedly prioritizes precision strikes against specific threats while adhering to principles that avoid broader regional destabilization. The statement is significant for international observers and diplomatic circles, offering an authoritative account of the engagement’s parameters. It seeks to provide transparency and mitigate misinformation regarding India's military postures and actions in the region.

Looking ahead, such official statements play a role in shaping narratives surrounding historical military operations and can influence future diplomatic engagements between India and Pakistan. The clarification from the Vice Air Chief reiterates India's position on the strategic use of force, particularly in sensitive geopolitical contexts, by detailing the exact nature of its military objectives and avoiding unintended misinterpretations.
