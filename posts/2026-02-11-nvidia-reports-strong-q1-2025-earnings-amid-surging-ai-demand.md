NVIDIA Corporation announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, which ended April 28, 2024, reporting a substantial increase in revenue and profit driven primarily by the escalating global demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. The chipmaker posted record revenue of $26.04 billion, an 18% increase from the previous quarter and a 262% rise year-over-year, significantly exceeding analyst forecasts. This performance underscores the company's central role in the ongoing expansion of the AI industry.

The surge in NVIDIA's financial performance is largely attributable to its Data Center segment, which continues to capitalize on the widespread adoption and development of generative AI technologies. Enterprises, cloud service providers, and sovereign nations are investing heavily in advanced computing capabilities, creating unprecedented demand for NVIDIA's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and networking solutions. The company's accelerators are crucial for training and deploying complex AI models, making them a critical component in the current technological landscape.

Key financial highlights for Q1 FY2025 include:

*   **Total Revenue:** $26.04 billion, representing a 262% increase year-over-year.
*   **Net Income:** $14.88 billion on a GAAP basis, a significant rise of 628% from the prior year.
*   **Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $5.98, an increase of 629% year-over-year.
*   **Data Center Revenue:** This segment generated $22.6 billion, marking a 427% increase from the same period last year and a 23% increase sequentially.
*   **Gross Margin:** GAAP gross margin reached 78.4%, up from 64.6% in the prior year.

NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang commented on the results, stating that the "next industrial revolution has begun," with companies and countries collaborating with NVIDIA to transition traditional data centers into AI factories. This shift, he noted, is driving new waves of growth across various industries as accelerated computing and generative AI reshape business operations and innovation.

In conjunction with its earnings report, NVIDIA also announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of its common stock, effective after the close of trading on June 7, 2024. Shareholders of record as of June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of common stock for every share held. The company also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 150%, raising it to $0.10 per share on a post-split basis, or $1.00 per share on a pre-split basis.

Looking ahead, NVIDIA provided robust guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, projecting revenue to be approximately $28.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company anticipates continued strong performance, driven by sustained demand for its AI platforms, including the new Blackwell architecture which is expected to commence shipments in the current quarter. These projections reflect the ongoing expansion of the AI market and NVIDIA's dominant position within it, indicating a sustained period of growth as global AI infrastructure continues to develop.
