New Delhi – On February 2, 2022, Congress Member of Parliament Rahul Gandhi delivered a comprehensive speech in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's Parliament, during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address. Gandhi used the platform to voice strong criticisms regarding the central government's economic policies, foreign relations, and its approach to employment generation, stating that the country was experiencing a "selling of India" and raising questions about its international standing.

Gandhi's economic critique centered on what he described as increasing wealth disparity and the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few. He explicitly questioned the government's actions by stating, "Are you not ashamed of selling India?", implying a critique of policies related to privatization and the perceived creation of monopolies. He further highlighted the issue of unemployment, asserting that the government had failed to create sufficient jobs and that initiatives such as "Make in India" had not yielded the promised results. The Congress leader spoke of the emergence of "two Indias," one for the wealthy elite and another for the impoverished majority, underscoring what he viewed as a growing socio-economic divide.

Transitioning to foreign policy, Gandhi challenged the government's strategic approach, particularly in relation to the United States, China, and Pakistan. He suggested a perceived compromise in India's foreign policy independence, remarking, "Now US will decide who we buy oil from, not our Prime Minister," which implied external influence over sovereign decisions. He also expressed concerns regarding the geopolitical situation with China, stating that India was facing international isolation and alleging that China possessed a clear strategic plan, while criticizing the government's response to the situation with both China and Pakistan.

Key points from Rahul Gandhi's address included:
*   **Economic Policies:** Accusations of "selling India" through unchecked privatization and wealth concentration benefiting a select few.
*   **Wealth Disparity:** Stating the existence of "two Indias – one for the rich, one for the poor," highlighting severe economic inequality.
*   **Unemployment:** Asserting that the government had failed to generate adequate employment opportunities across the nation.
*   **Foreign Policy Autonomy:** Questioning India's independent decision-making on international matters, specifically regarding oil procurement, with the remark, "Now US will decide who we buy oil from, not our Prime Minister."
*   **Geopolitical Strategy:** Expressing concerns that "India is completely isolated and surrounded," and alleging that "the Chinese have a plan" concerning India's borders and international position.

Gandhi's remarks were part of the parliamentary debate, a standard democratic process where opposition parties present their alternative perspectives and scrutinize the government's performance and agenda. His speech aimed to draw national attention to perceived deficiencies in economic management and foreign policy, thereby setting a tone for further parliamentary discourse and anticipated responses from the ruling party.

The speech is expected to elicit rebuttals from members of the ruling party as the debate on the Motion of Thanks continues in Parliament. Such exchanges are a fundamental aspect of India's parliamentary democracy, providing a platform for opposition leaders to examine government policies and performance.
