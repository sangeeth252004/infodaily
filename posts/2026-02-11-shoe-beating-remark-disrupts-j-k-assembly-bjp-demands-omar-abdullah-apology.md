Proceedings in the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly were significantly disrupted during a recent session following a controversial "shoe-beating" remark attributed to National Conference leader Omar Abdullah. The comment triggered an immediate uproar from members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who vehemently demanded an unconditional apology from Mr. Abdullah, leading to a temporary halt in the assembly’s scheduled business.

The incident occurred as legislative discussions were underway, with the specific context of Mr. Abdullah's remark becoming a focal point of contention. While the precise words were not immediately released verbatim by the assembly secretariat, reports confirm the phrase "shoe-beating" was used, inciting strong objections from the ruling BJP benches. BJP members swiftly rose from their seats, raising slogans and demanding that the remark be expunged from the official records and that Mr. Abdullah issue a public apology for what they deemed an undignified and threatening statement.

*   **Key Details of the Uproar:**
    *   BJP legislators vociferously protested, chanting slogans and expressing strong condemnation.
    *   The Presiding Officer of the assembly faced challenges in restoring order amidst the heightened tensions.
    *   BJP members stated the remark was highly objectionable and violated parliamentary decorum.
    *   Demands for Mr. Abdullah's apology were central to the BJP's protest.

Sources within the assembly indicated that BJP members viewed the comment as an incitement to violence or a disrespectful portrayal of political discourse. A senior BJP leader, addressing reporters outside the assembly hall, stated, "Such language has no place in a democratic institution like our assembly. It is an insult to every legislator and the people we represent. Omar Abdullah must apologize immediately and unconditionally." The leader emphasized the need to uphold the dignity of the legislative process and prevent the use of inflammatory rhetoric.

The National Conference, while acknowledging Mr. Abdullah's comments, had not issued an official statement regarding the demand for an apology at the time of reporting. However, political analysts suggest that such remarks, whether intended literally or as a figure of speech, often escalate tensions in an already polarized political landscape. The incident underscores ongoing ideological differences and parliamentary friction between the National Conference and the BJP within the Jammu and Kashmir political sphere.

The session eventually resumed after interventions by the Presiding Officer and appeals for calm, though the atmosphere remained charged. The demand for an apology from Omar Abdullah continues to be pressed by the BJP, indicating that the matter may have lingering political repercussions. The incident highlights the challenges in maintaining decorum and constructive debate in legislative bodies, particularly in regions with complex political histories like Jammu and Kashmir. Further developments are expected as both parties navigate the aftermath of the contentious remark and its implications for future assembly sessions.
