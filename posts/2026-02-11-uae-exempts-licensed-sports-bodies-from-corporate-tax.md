The United Arab Emirates has officially exempted licensed sports clubs and federations from corporate tax, a measure effective from June 1, 2023. This exemption applies to entities operating within the nation's sports sector that meet specific non-profit criteria outlined in the UAE's new corporate tax legislation and subsequent ministerial decisions.

This development follows the introduction of a federal corporate tax in the UAE, enacted through Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses. While the standard corporate tax rate is 9% on taxable income exceeding AED 375,000, the new provision aims to support the growth and sustainability of the country's sports industry. The Ministerial Decision No. 116 of 2023 specifically addresses the conditions for qualifying public benefit entities, which can include sports organizations.

To qualify for corporate tax exemption, sports bodies, clubs, and federations must adhere to a strict set of conditions stipulated by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA):

*   **Licensing:** The entity must be licensed or recognized by a competent local or federal authority in the UAE. This ensures official oversight and legitimization of the organization's activities.
*   **Non-Profit Purpose:** Their primary activities must be exclusively non-profit, focusing on the public benefit or the advancement of sports within the community.
*   **Limited Commercial Activities:** The entity should not conduct any business or commercial activities beyond those directly related to achieving its public benefit purpose. Any revenue generated from such related activities must be reinvested solely into the entity's non-profit objectives and not be used for profit distribution.
*   **No Profit Distribution:** There must be no distribution of profit or income to owners, members, or any private individual or entity. All financial surpluses must be retained and used for the entity's stated purpose.
*   **Asset Use:** The entity's assets and income must be utilized solely to fulfill its public benefit purpose. Should the entity be liquidated, its remaining assets must be transferred to another qualifying public benefit entity in the UAE.

The exemption is designed to foster a robust and self-sustaining sports ecosystem within the UAE. By alleviating the tax burden, the government seeks to encourage greater investment in sports infrastructure, youth development programs, talent nurturing, and the hosting of international sporting events. This aligns with the UAE's broader strategic goals of promoting a healthy lifestyle among its residents and establishing the nation as a premier global sporting hub.

The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) is responsible for processing applications and ensuring compliance with the outlined criteria. Sports organizations seeking this exemption are required to apply for a 'qualified public benefit entity' status and demonstrate ongoing adherence to the conditions to maintain their tax-exempt standing. The measure underscores the government's commitment to supporting non-profit sectors that contribute significantly to the social and cultural fabric of the UAE.
