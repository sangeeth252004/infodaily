Mumbai, India – The West Indies national cricket team secured a significant victory over defending champions England in a Super 8 stage match of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup on June 22, 2024, at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. The win, anchored by a decisive bowling performance from spinner Gudakesh Motie and crucial batting from Sherfane Rutherford, saw England defeated by 28 runs, placing pressure on their tournament progression.

Opting to bat first after winning the toss, West Indies posted a competitive total of 178 for 6 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. The innings saw a crucial late surge, primarily driven by Sherfane Rutherford, who delivered a rapid 47 runs from just 29 deliveries, including four fours and three sixes. His partnership with Andre Russell for the sixth wicket added 55 runs in only 4.2 overs, providing the impetus needed to reach a challenging target. Earlier, captain Rovman Powell contributed 36 runs from 24 balls, steadying the innings after some early wickets. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid with figures of 2 for 29, managed to pick up wickets at regular intervals but could not contain the late scoring acceleration.

England's chase began cautiously, but they struggled to build significant partnerships against a disciplined West Indies bowling attack. Openers Phil Salt and Jos Buttler provided a start, but the momentum shifted dramatically with the introduction of Gudakesh Motie. The left-arm orthodox spinner dismantled England’s middle order, claiming key wickets and stifling the scoring rate.

Key moments in England's innings included:
*   Phil Salt's dismissal for 26 runs (19 balls) by Motie in the sixth over.
*   Jos Buttler's departure for 34 runs (28 balls), also to Motie, in the ninth over.
*   Motie's third wicket, Jonny Bairstow (12 runs from 10 balls), effectively crippling England's chase in the twelfth over.
*   England's top three batsmen were removed by Motie within six overs, for a combined cost of just 25 runs from his four overs.

England ultimately concluded their innings at 150 for 9 wickets in 20 overs, falling short of the target. Motie was named Player of the Match for his match-winning spell of 3 wickets for 25 runs.

This result marks a critical moment in the tournament's Super 8 stage. For the West Indies, the victory provides a significant boost to their net run rate and confidence heading into their subsequent fixtures. For England, the loss necessitates strong performances in their remaining matches to maintain their qualification hopes for the semi-finals, emphasizing the competitive nature of the tournament. Both teams are scheduled to play their next matches within the coming days.
