India's Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) has officially cleared a proposal for the procurement of 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA), setting the stage for what could become the nation's largest-ever defence contract. The decision aims to significantly bolster the combat capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) by replacing its aging fleet of Soviet-era aircraft. While the precise value remains subject to negotiation, industry estimates suggest the deal could exceed $20 billion (approximately ₹1.5 lakh crore).

This strategic move underscores India's commitment to modernizing its military assets amidst evolving geopolitical dynamics. The acquisition plan mandates a combination of directly imported aircraft and a substantial portion manufactured domestically under the "Make in India" initiative, involving technology transfer to an Indian production agency. This approach is designed to foster indigenous defence manufacturing capabilities and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers over the long term.

The Rafale fighter jet, manufactured by French aerospace company Dassault Aviation, is widely considered a strong frontrunner for the significant contract. This advantage stems from India's existing operational experience with 36 Rafale aircraft, which were inducted into the IAF following a separate agreement in 2016 for approximately ₹59,000 crore (€7.8 billion). The commonality in logistics, maintenance infrastructure, and pilot training with the current Rafale fleet could streamline integration and operational readiness for any additional units.

The DAC's approval represents a crucial initial step in a multi-stage procurement process. The subsequent phases typically involve:

*   **Request for Information (RFI):** Global aircraft manufacturers submit initial details.
*   **Request for Proposal (RFP):** Detailed technical and commercial bids are invited from shortlisted vendors.
*   **Technical and Commercial Evaluations:** Rigorous assessment of aircraft capabilities, transfer of technology proposals, and pricing.
*   **Contract Negotiations:** Finalizing terms and conditions with the chosen vendor.

Beyond Dassault Aviation's Rafale, other global contenders anticipated to participate in the competitive bidding process include Boeing with its F/A-18 Super Hornet and F-15EX, Lockheed Martin's F-21, Saab's Gripen, and the Eurofighter Typhoon. Each manufacturer is expected to present compelling "Make in India" proposals, emphasizing local production and economic benefits.

The primary objective of this massive acquisition is to address the IAF's dwindling squadron strength, which has fallen below its authorized complement. The new MRFA jets are intended to phasedly replace older aircraft such as the MiG-21s, MiG-29s, Jaguars, and Mirage 2000s, ensuring the IAF maintains a robust and technologically advanced deterrent capability. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), India's state-owned aerospace major, is widely expected to be the lead Indian production partner in this ambitious undertaking, collaborating with the chosen foreign vendor to facilitate local manufacturing and integration.
