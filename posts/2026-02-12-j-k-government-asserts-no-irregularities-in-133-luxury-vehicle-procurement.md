The Jammu and Kashmir government has officially stated that the acquisition of 133 luxury vehicles adhered to all established financial norms and procurement guidelines, asserting a complete absence of irregularities in the process. The claim comes amidst ongoing public scrutiny regarding government expenditure and the utilization of public funds for administrative purchases within the Union Territory.

Officials from the J&K administration detailed the procurement methodology, emphasizing that the purchase was executed in full compliance with the General Financial Rules (GFR) and other relevant regulations governing government tenders and expenditures. The statement aims to address any public concerns or allegations of impropriety that may have arisen concerning the substantial vehicle acquisition. The administration highlighted its commitment to transparency and fiscal responsibility in all government transactions.

Key aspects of the government's position include:

*   **Adherence to Due Process:** The J&K government affirmed that all stages of the procurement, from tendering to final delivery, followed prescribed protocols. This reportedly included public tendering, competitive bidding, and thorough evaluation processes.
*   **Financial Compliance:** Officials underscored that the financial allocations for the vehicles were sanctioned through appropriate channels and that expenditures were consistent with budgetary provisions. Checks and balances inherent in government accounting practices were reportedly maintained throughout the process.
*   **Purpose of Acquisition:** While specific departmental allocations were not detailed in the general assertion, the acquisition of 133 vehicles is typically justified for various administrative functions, including transportation for officials, security details, and operational needs across different government departments in the Union Territory.
*   **Accountability:** The government's declaration suggests an internal review or a readiness to provide documentation validating the legality and fairness of the purchase, reinforcing its stance on accountability.

The purchase of such a significant number of luxury vehicles by any government entity often draws public attention, particularly concerning the judicious use of taxpayer money. The J&K government's preemptive assertion of no irregularities is a direct response to potential or existing questions regarding the transparency and necessity of these expenditures. The administration’s statement aims to reassure the public that due diligence was exercised and that the procurement decisions were sound.

Moving forward, the J&K government's assertion is expected to be followed by a continued focus on transparency. Public documentation related to the tendering process and the financial details of the acquisition may be released or made accessible to reinforce the government's claims and maintain public trust. The administration reiterates its commitment to ethical governance and the responsible management of public resources.
