The chief of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUIH), a prominent Islamic organisation in India, has publicly criticised a recent government mandate concerning 'Vande Mataram', describing it as a "sectarian agenda." The statement marks a notable intervention from a key religious body regarding national symbols and government policy.

The criticism stems from perceived implications of the government's directive related to 'Vande Mataram', which holds significance as India's national song. While 'Vande Mataram' is revered by many, certain sections of the Muslim community have historically expressed reservations about some of its lyrical content, citing potential conflicts with their monotheistic beliefs. The JUIH chief’s statement highlights these long-standing concerns, framing the government’s move as one that could exacerbate divisions rather than foster national unity.

Key aspects of the JUIH chief's criticism include:
*   **"Sectarian agenda":** The primary point of contention, suggesting the mandate serves a divisive purpose under the guise of nationalism. This phrasing indicates a belief that the directive targets specific communities or religious sentiments.
*   **Concerns over religious freedom:** The criticism implicitly, and at times explicitly, touches upon the right to religious practice and belief, arguing that imposing the singing or recitation of 'Vande Mataram' could infringe upon the religious freedom of certain groups.
*   **National identity vs. religious identity:** The statement underscores the ongoing debate in India regarding the balance between national symbols and the diverse religious identities within the country.

Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, founded in 1919, is one of the oldest and most influential Islamic scholarly organisations in India, known for its advocacy on issues concerning the Muslim community and its stance on secularism. Its leadership's pronouncements often carry significant weight within the community and contribute to public discourse on national policies.

The government's mandate on 'Vande Mataram' has not been without prior discussion. Debates surrounding the song's compulsory use, particularly in educational institutions or public gatherings, have surfaced periodically. Proponents often argue that it is a symbol of national pride and an integral part of India's freedom struggle, while critics, like JUIH, voice objections based on religious grounds or concerns about forced patriotism.

The JUIH chief's latest criticism is expected to reignite public and political debate on the issue. It places renewed focus on the government's approach to cultural and nationalistic mandates and their reception among India's diverse population. Further reactions from political parties, other religious organisations, and civil society groups are anticipated as the discussion unfolds. The statement underscores the complex interplay of nationalism, religious sentiment, and government policy in India's pluralistic society.
