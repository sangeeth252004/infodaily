MUMBAI – The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has initiated a process to review and potentially overhaul the guidelines governing the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, formally inviting feedback from stakeholders and the public. The central bank set a deadline of March 6 for submitting comments and suggestions on the proposed changes, signaling a significant move to modernize and refine this critical agricultural credit facility.

The KCC scheme, originally launched in 1998 by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), aims to provide farmers with timely and adequate credit for their agricultural operations. It offers a revolving cash credit facility to meet short-term credit requirements for crop cultivation, post-harvest expenses, produce marketing loans, consumption requirements of farmer households, and working capital for maintenance of farm assets and allied activities. The scheme has been instrumental in facilitating access to institutional credit for millions of farmers across India.

The proposed overhaul comes amidst evolving agricultural practices, technological advancements, and the government's broader agenda for financial inclusion and digital transformation in rural areas. While specific details of the proposed amendments have not been publicly released beyond the announcement seeking feedback, typical regulatory reviews of such schemes often target areas such as:

*   **Eligibility Criteria:** Reassessing who qualifies for KCC to ensure wider reach, particularly to small and marginal farmers, tenant farmers, and oral lessees who often face hurdles in accessing formal credit.
*   **Credit Limit Assessment:** Revising methodologies for determining credit limits to better align with current input costs, crop cycles, and diversification into allied activities like animal husbandry and fisheries.
*   **Digitization and Streamlining:** Simplifying the application, sanction, and disbursement processes through technological integration, potentially reducing paperwork and processing time.
*   **Repayment Flexibility:** Introducing more flexible repayment options tailored to the vagaries of agricultural income and climate-related risks.
*   **Interest Subvention Schemes:** Examining the operational aspects of existing interest subvention benefits to ensure they effectively reach the intended beneficiaries.
*   **Monitoring and Supervision:** Enhancing mechanisms for better oversight and effective implementation by lending institutions.

The KCC scheme is implemented by commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs), small finance banks (SFBs), and cooperatives. These institutions, along with farmer associations, agricultural experts, state governments, and individual farmers, are among the key stakeholders whose input is being sought. The RBI's consultative approach underscores its commitment to developing a comprehensive framework that addresses existing challenges and future requirements of the agricultural sector.

The outcome of this review is expected to have far-reaching implications for India's agricultural financing landscape. A revised KCC framework could potentially enhance credit flow to farmers, improve their financial resilience, and support agricultural productivity. Following the March 6 deadline, the RBI will review the received feedback before finalizing and issuing the updated guidelines, which will then be adopted by all implementing banks. The timeline for the finalization and implementation of the new rules will depend on the complexity of the proposed changes and the volume of stakeholder responses.
