Federal courts have sentenced two individuals, Arif Sajid, 59, of Karachi, Pakistan, and Hafiz Mustafa, 64, of Houston, Texas, for their roles in orchestrating a $10 million Medicare fraud scheme. The sentences, issued recently, conclude a multi-year investigation into a complex operation that defrauded the U.S. government's healthcare program through fraudulent billings for medically unnecessary services.

Arif Sajid received a 15-year prison sentence, while Hafiz Mustafa was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Both defendants were also ordered to pay $10 million in restitution, reflecting the total amount of fraudulent claims submitted to Medicare. The case highlights the persistent efforts by federal authorities to combat healthcare fraud, which diverts essential resources and impacts taxpayer funds.

The scheme involved the creation and utilization of multiple shell corporations established in the United States. These companies were used to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare for various services, including genetic testing and durable medical equipment, which were determined to be medically unnecessary or never provided.

Key details of the fraudulent operation include:
*   **Shell Corporations:** Sajid and Mustafa allegedly controlled several shell companies, primarily established to facilitate the submission of false claims to Medicare. These entities frequently changed names and addresses to evade detection.
*   **Recruitment of Beneficiaries:** The defendants and their associates engaged in the illegal recruitment of Medicare beneficiaries. These beneficiaries were often offered inducements or paid kickbacks to provide their personal information, which was then used to bill Medicare for unneeded services.
*   **International Coordination:** Arif Sajid operated largely from Pakistan, directing parts of the scheme remotely, while Hafiz Mustafa managed operations from Houston, Texas. Their collaboration allowed the fraud to span international borders, complicating law enforcement efforts.
*   **Types of Fraudulent Services:** A significant portion of the claims involved billing Medicare for advanced genetic testing, often marketed as cancer screening, and durable medical equipment. These services were frequently billed without proper medical necessity or without a legitimate referral from a physician.

The Department of Justice, in conjunction with agencies like the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) and the FBI, has been actively pursuing individuals involved in healthcare fraud. This specific case was part of a broader crackdown on schemes targeting federal health programs, which often involve organized criminal networks. The investigation and prosecution were conducted by the Department of Justice's Criminal Division's Fraud Section.

The successful prosecution and sentencing of Sajid and Mustafa underscore the government's commitment to protecting the integrity of Medicare and holding accountable those who exploit federal healthcare programs for personal gain. Authorities indicate that efforts to identify and prosecute individuals involved in similar schemes will continue, aiming to deter future fraudulent activities against government-funded healthcare initiatives.
