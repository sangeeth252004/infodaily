The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has activated a three-day correction window for candidates who have applied for the Civil Services Examination (CSE) 2026. This facility, accessible on the official UPSC website, upsc.gov.in, allows aspirants to review and rectify inaccuracies in their online application forms within a specified period. The precise dates for this three-day window are detailed in the official notification available on the UPSC portal.

This provision holds significant importance for thousands of candidates aspiring to join various All India Services and Central Civil Services. Submitting an application with erroneous information, particularly concerning personal details, photographs, or signatures, can lead to complications, including potential rejection, at later stages of the rigorous examination process. The correction window serves as a critical opportunity for applicants to ensure all submitted data is accurate and compliant with the UPSC's stringent guidelines, thereby mitigating future issues.

Aspirants are required to log in to their registered accounts on the UPSC portal using their credentials to access and modify their submitted application forms. The correction facility generally permits amendments to a range of non-critical fields. Candidates are strongly advised to meticulously review all sections of their application, encompassing personal details such as name, date of birth, category, gender, and contact information. Educational qualifications, parental details, and the clarity and compliance of uploaded photographs and signatures should also be thoroughly verified.

While a broad spectrum of details can be amended, applicants should note that certain critical fields, such as the chosen examination centre, are typically not alterable once confirmed during the initial submission. It is imperative for candidates to refer to the official UPSC notification for the Civil Services Examination 2026 to understand the precise parameters, editable fields, and any restrictions pertaining to the correction facility. Any changes made must be saved and formally confirmed within the designated three-day timeframe. Failure to rectify errors within this window will result in the application being processed with the original, uncorrected information.

Key details for aspirants utilizing the correction window include:
*   **Access Portal:** Visit the Union Public Service Commission's official website, upsc.gov.in.
*   **Login Credentials:** Use the existing registration ID and password to access the application form.
*   **Duration:** The correction facility is active for a period of three consecutive days. Exact dates are published in the official CSE 2026 notification.
*   **Comprehensive Review:** Scrutinize all personal data, educational qualifications, address, and category details.
*   **Upload Verification:** Ensure uploaded photographs and signatures adhere to UPSC specifications regarding size, format, and clarity.
*   **Official Notification:** Consult the detailed Civil Services Examination 2026 notification for definitive guidelines on modifiable fields and procedures.

Following the closure of this correction window, the UPSC will proceed with the processing of all applications for CSE 2026. Aspirants are advised to maintain regular checks on the official website for subsequent announcements concerning admit card releases, detailed examination schedules, and other vital updates pertaining to the Civil Services Examination 2026. This timely provision of a correction window aims to enhance the integrity of the application process and minimize potential discrepancies for all candidates.
