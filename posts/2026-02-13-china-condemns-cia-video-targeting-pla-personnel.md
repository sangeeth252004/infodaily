The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) publicly released a Mandarin-language video campaign directly appealing to members of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) for intelligence, an action that swiftly drew strong condemnation from Beijing. Chinese officials and state media outlets characterized the move as an act of sabotage and a direct challenge to national security. The two-minute animated video, disseminated across various digital platforms, aims to recruit disillusioned Chinese military personnel to share classified information with the U.S. intelligence agency.

The video, presented as a fictional narrative, depicts a PLA officer who becomes disenchanted with the Chinese government and subsequently collaborates with the CIA. It outlines a pathway for individuals to securely transmit sensitive information, framing such cooperation as a form of "redemption" for those who feel their ideals have been betrayed. The CIA's objective, as implied by the campaign, is to establish secure and confidential channels for intelligence gathering within China's military apparatus. This initiative marks a public escalation in the intelligence competition between the two global powers, directly targeting the loyalty of China's armed forces.

Beijing's response was immediate and critical. Chinese state media, including the Global Times, published editorials and reports strongly denouncing the video. These outlets dismissed the CIA's production as "pathetic" and "amateurish," arguing that it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese patriotism and national resolve. Official statements from Chinese authorities reiterated warnings against foreign espionage and emphasized the paramount importance of national security. The government urged its citizens, particularly those within sensitive sectors like the military, to maintain heightened vigilance against external attempts at infiltration and subversion.

The Chinese government has long maintained a strict stance against foreign intelligence operations, frequently conducting public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about counter-espionage measures and the legal ramifications of collaborating with foreign entities. The release of the CIA video reignites concerns in Beijing about external efforts to destabilize the country's military and political structures. This incident underscores the ongoing tensions in intelligence and security domains between the United States and China, manifesting in overt public appeals and immediate counter-propaganda efforts.
