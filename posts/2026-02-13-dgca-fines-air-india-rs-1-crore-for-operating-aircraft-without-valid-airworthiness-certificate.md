India's aviation regulatory body, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has imposed a financial penalty of Rs 1 crore on Air India. The fine was levied due to the airline's operation of an Airbus A320 aircraft on scheduled passenger flights without a valid Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA). The DGCA announced the enforcement action on January 20, 2024, following an investigation into the matter.

The regulatory action stems from an incident between January 27 and January 30, 2023, during which Air India operated the Airbus A320 for more than 13 hours. The aircraft's Certificate of Airworthiness had expired on January 26, 2023, making its subsequent operation a breach of aviation safety regulations. The DGCA stated that such a lapse "eroded public confidence" and demonstrated a clear disregard for established safety protocols, which are paramount in commercial aviation.

A Certificate of Airworthiness is a mandatory document issued by a country's civil aviation authority, confirming that an aircraft is fit for flight and meets the design and operational standards specified by the certifying authority. Its validity is crucial for ensuring the ongoing safety and structural integrity of an aircraft throughout its operational life. Operating an aircraft without a current CofA constitutes a serious violation of aviation law, as it implies the aircraft's continued compliance with safety standards cannot be officially guaranteed.

In addition to the financial penalty on the airline, the DGCA also mandated disciplinary action against specific individuals holding critical positions within Air India. The regulator ordered the removal of three post holders deemed responsible for the oversight. These individuals include:

*   The Head of Operations: Removed from their position and fined Rs 3 lakh.
*   The Chief of Quality: Removed from their position and fined Rs 3 lakh.
*   The Executive Vice President for Flight Safety: Removed from their position.

The DGCA's investigation revealed that the airline failed to adhere to the provisions of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and the Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) related to the continuous airworthiness of aircraft. The lapse was identified during a regulatory audit conducted by the DGCA, which highlighted systemic deficiencies in Air India's internal safety oversight and quality assurance processes. The regulator noted that the airline's systems did not effectively prevent or detect the expiry of the critical airworthiness document.

Air India acknowledged the DGCA's action and stated that it had taken note of the findings. The airline also confirmed it has initiated corrective steps and implemented comprehensive training programs for its crew concerning documentation protocols and airworthiness procedures. This incident underscores the DGCA's firm stance on enforcing aviation safety regulations and its commitment to holding airlines accountable for compliance failures. The regulatory body continues to monitor airlines to ensure strict adherence to safety standards, aiming to maintain the integrity and safety of air travel within Indian airspace.
