The Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) has officially released the admit cards for its Multi-Tasking Staff (MTS) examinations slated for 2026. Aspirants who successfully applied for these positions can now access and download their respective hall tickets directly from the board's official website, dsssb.delhi.gov.in. This release is a critical development for all candidates preparing for the upcoming recruitment examinations.

The admit card serves as a mandatory document for entry into the examination hall, functioning as proof of registration and eligibility. Candidates are strongly advised to download and print their admit cards well in advance of their examination dates to mitigate any potential last-minute technical difficulties or complications. The download process necessitates candidates to input their specific login credentials, typically comprising an application number and date of birth, into the designated portal on the DSSSB website. Failure to present a valid admit card, alongside a government-issued photo identification, will result in denial of entry to the examination venue.

To download the DSSSB MTS 2026 admit card, candidates are directed to navigate to the official website, dsssb.delhi.gov.in. A prominent link titled "Download Admit Card for MTS Examination 2026" or similar phrasing will be available on the website's homepage. Upon clicking this link, candidates will be redirected to a secure login page where they must accurately enter their application number and date of birth. After successful login, the admit card will be displayed on the screen, from which it can be downloaded and subsequently printed. Candidates are encouraged to secure multiple printouts for future reference and safekeeping.

Key details that candidates must meticulously verify on their downloaded admit card include:
*   The candidate's full name, father's name, and recent photograph
*   The assigned roll number and unique application number
*   The precise date and time of the examination
*   The specified reporting time and the gate closing time for the examination center
*   The complete and accurate address of the designated examination center
*   Specific instructions and guidelines pertaining to the examination day, including lists of prohibited items and rules of conduct within the venue
*   The candidate's category (e.g., General, OBC, SC, ST, EWS), which should match their application details

Candidates are urged to thoroughly review all information printed on their admit card for accuracy. Any discrepancies identified in personal details, examination center allocation, or other critical information should be immediately reported to the DSSSB helpdesk or relevant authorities. Contact details for such queries are typically provided on the official website. Early reporting of discrepancies ensures sufficient time for rectification before the scheduled examination dates.

The Multi-Tasking Staff positions under DSSSB generally encompass Group 'C' non-gazetted roles across various departments and autonomous bodies operating under the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD). These roles are integral to the efficient functioning of administrative operations. The recruitment process typically involves written examinations designed to assess candidates' general awareness, reasoning ability, numerical ability, and proficiency in both Hindi and English languages.

As the examination period for the 2026 MTS recruitment approaches, candidates are advised to continue their preparation diligently and to regularly monitor the DSSSB official website for any further announcements, updates to the examination schedule, or additional important instructions. Adherence to all stipulated guidelines and timely access to official communications are crucial steps for all applicants.
