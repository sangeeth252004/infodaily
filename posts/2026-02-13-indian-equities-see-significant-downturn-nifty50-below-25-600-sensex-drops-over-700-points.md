Indian equity markets concluded Friday's trading session on February 13, 2026, with significant declines across key benchmark indices. The National Stock Exchange's (NSE) Nifty50 index closed below the crucial 25,600 mark, while the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) Sensex registered a substantial fall of over 700 points. This broad-based selling pressure marked a challenging day for investors on Dalal Street.

The Nifty50, which serves as a barometer for the Indian economy by tracking the performance of 50 large-cap companies across various sectors, closed at approximately 25,580 points, representing a decline of about 1.6% from its previous close. Concurrently, the BSE Sensex, comprising 30 well-established companies listed on the BSE, settled around 70,300 points, reflecting a drop of approximately 1.0% for the day. Both indices witnessed sustained pressure throughout the trading day, extending losses in the latter half of the session.

The downturn led to a noticeable erosion in investor wealth, with the combined market capitalization of BSE-listed companies experiencing a significant reduction. Market breadth remained predominantly negative, indicating that a substantial majority of stocks across various sectors declined during the session. This widespread selling suggested a cautious sentiment prevailing among market participants. While specific triggers for the day's sharp decline were not immediately clear, market observers noted the broader trend of cautious investor behaviour.

Key details from the trading session include:
*   **Nifty50 Closing:** Closed below 25,600 points, specifically at approximately 25,580.
*   **BSE Sensex Decline:** Dropped over 700 points, settling around 70,300.
*   **Date:** Friday, February 13, 2026.
*   **Market Breadth:** Preponderance of declining stocks over advancing ones across the exchanges.
*   **Investor Wealth Impact:** Significant reduction in overall market capitalization of listed equities.

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring both domestic and international developments that could influence investor sentiment in the upcoming trading sessions. The performance of global markets and any emerging economic data will likely play a role in shaping the direction of Indian equities as investors assess the evolving landscape. The focus will remain on stability and potential recovery in the next week's trading activity.
