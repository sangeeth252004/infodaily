Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national, pleaded guilty on Monday, June 17, 2024, in a U.S. federal court in New York to charges of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire. The charges relate to his involvement in a plot to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a prominent Sikh separatist and dual U.S.-Canadian citizen, on American soil. Gupta, 52, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan federal court.

Gupta's plea confirms his role in a scheme that allegedly involved an unnamed Indian government employee to arrange the killing of Pannun, who serves as the general counsel for the organization Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). The U.S. Department of Justice initially unsealed an indictment against Gupta in November 2023, detailing the alleged plot. Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic in June 2023 and subsequently extradited to the United States earlier this month to face the charges.

According to court documents and prosecutors' statements, Gupta was recruited by an individual identified as "CC-1," described as an Indian government employee, to orchestrate Pannun's murder in New York City. The plot allegedly began in May 2023. Gupta then contacted a confidential informant (CI) in the U.S., believing the CI could connect him with a hitman. Unbeknownst to Gupta, the CI was working with U.S. law enforcement, and the CI introduced Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent posing as a hitman.

Key details surrounding the plot include:
*   Gupta allegedly agreed to pay the purported hitman $100,000 for the assassination.
*   An initial payment of $15,000 was transferred by Gupta to the undercover agent.
*   Gupta provided the agent with personal information about Pannun, including his address and details about his daily routine.
*   The plot was reportedly initiated after Pannun continued to advocate for the creation of an independent Sikh state, Khalistan, and called for a non-binding referendum on the issue.

This case has significant diplomatic implications for the relationship between the United States and India. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco have both issued statements emphasizing the U.S. government's commitment to protecting its citizens and upholding its sovereignty against transnational repression. Following the initial allegations, India's government stated it would investigate the claims and formed a high-level inquiry committee to examine the issue, acknowledging the serious nature of the allegations involving a government official.

Gupta faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the charge of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire. His sentencing date has not yet been set. The plea agreement marks a significant development in the ongoing legal proceedings and the broader diplomatic discussions surrounding the alleged plot. The U.S. continues to monitor the case and any further investigations related to the alleged involvement of foreign government officials.
