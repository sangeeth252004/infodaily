Prime Minister Narendra Modi commenced his third term in office by signing his inaugural files at his new workplace, designated as "Seva Teerth." The initial actions taken by the Prime Minister focused on key governmental priorities, including initiatives aimed at empowering "Lakhpati Didis," providing support to farmers, and fostering the growth of start-ups across the nation. These early endorsements signal the immediate agenda and areas of focus for the new administration.

The signing of files pertaining to "Lakhpati Didis" underscores a continued commitment to women's economic empowerment. The 'Lakhpati Didi' scheme, a flagship initiative, aims to enable women from rural self-help groups (SHGs) to achieve a sustainable annual income of at least INR 100,000 (one lakh rupees). This program has been instrumental in enhancing the financial independence and livelihood security of women in various communities. The Prime Minister's immediate attention to this initiative suggests a renewed push or expansion of efforts to uplift rural women and integrate them further into the economic mainstream.

Concurrently, Prime Minister Modi also approved files related to the welfare and support of farmers. The agricultural sector remains a cornerstone of the Indian economy, employing a significant portion of the population. Governmental support for farmers typically encompasses a range of measures, including financial aid, irrigation projects, access to modern technology, and market reforms. The inclusion of farmer-centric initiatives among the first official actions highlights the administration's resolve to address the challenges faced by the agricultural community and ensure food security and rural prosperity.

Furthermore, the Prime Minister's early engagements at "Seva Teerth" also included signing files focused on bolstering the start-up ecosystem. India has witnessed a significant boom in its start-up landscape in recent years, becoming one of the world's largest ecosystems for new businesses and innovation. Government efforts in this domain typically involve providing financial incentives, simplifying regulatory processes, fostering innovation hubs, and encouraging venture capital investments. The emphasis on start-ups from the outset indicates a strategic priority to drive technological advancement, create employment opportunities, and enhance India's position as a global innovation leader.

These initial actions by Prime Minister Modi at his new office provide a clear indication of the government's immediate strategic focus for its third term. By prioritizing social welfare through women's empowerment, ensuring agricultural stability, and promoting economic innovation through start-ups, the administration has laid out a multi-faceted approach to national development. The specific details of the directives contained within these files are expected to be elaborated upon in subsequent official announcements, outlining the implementation strategies and targets for each of these critical sectors.
