Bangladesh's newly formed cabinet is scheduled to be sworn in on Saturday, February 17, 2024. The oath-taking ceremony will commence at 7:00 PM local time at the Presidential Palace, Banga Bhaban, in Dhaka. President Mohammed Shahabuddin will administer the oath of office and oath of secrecy to the new ministers, state ministers, and deputy ministers. This event formally establishes the new government following the general elections held on January 7, 2024.

The swearing-in follows the decisive victory of the Awami League in the 12th parliamentary elections. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who secured her fifth term, is expected to lead the new council of ministers. Following the official declaration of election results, President Shahabuddin invited Ms. Hasina, as the leader of the majority party, to form the government, a constitutional process affirming the mandate of the winning political entity. The formation of the new cabinet represents the next critical step in the establishment of the administration, enabling the government to fully commence its legislative and executive functions.

Sources familiar with the preparations indicate that the cabinet is expected to comprise approximately 37 members, including a mix of full ministers, state ministers, and deputy ministers. This composition aims to integrate experienced public servants with new representatives, reflecting both continuity and strategic adjustments in governmental policy. Each selected member will pledge to uphold the Constitution of Bangladesh and serve the nation with dedication and integrity. The specific portfolios for each minister are typically announced shortly after the oath-taking ceremony, detailing their respective responsibilities within the government structure.

The ceremony itself is a constitutional imperative, symbolizing the peaceful transition of power and the commencement of the new parliamentary term. It provides the executive branch with the formal legal authority to implement its electoral mandate, introduce new legislation, and manage state affairs. For the nation, it marks the official start of a new political era, with the cabinet tasked with addressing key national priorities. These priorities generally encompass areas such as sustained economic growth, infrastructure development, social welfare programs, and the cultivation of robust international relations.
