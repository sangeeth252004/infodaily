The Indian Army has initiated a comprehensive recruitment drive to fill 25,000 Agniveer positions across various regiments and services. This latest recruitment cycle marks a significant operational step in the ongoing implementation of the Agnipath scheme, a foundational reform for armed forces personnel induction. Official announcements accompanying the drive have also indicated the Army's plans to incrementally increase the intake of Agniveers in subsequent recruitment phases, reflecting a long-term strategy for personnel management.

The Agnipath scheme, formally introduced in June 2022, fundamentally altered the recruitment process for soldiers, sailors, and airmen into the Indian Armed Forces. Under this model, personnel are recruited for a four-year term, with approximately 25% of each batch selected for permanent commission based on rigorous performance evaluations, willingness, and medical fitness upon the completion of their initial tenure. The scheme aims to cultivate a younger, more technologically adept fighting force while optimizing defence pension outlays, which constitute a significant component of the national defence budget.

For prospective candidates, the Agniveer recruitment process typically involves an initial online application and registration, followed by a computer-based examination, physical fitness tests, and detailed medical assessments. Successful recruits undergo a structured and specialized training period, the duration of which is tailored to their respective roles and service branches, before being deployed for active duty.

Upon the completion of their four-year service, Agniveers who are not retained for permanent service receive a 'Seva Nidhi' package. This financial package includes their accumulated contributions along with a matching contribution from the government, which is tax-exempt. Additionally, exiting Agniveers are provided with skill certificates and receive assistance aimed at facilitating their transition into post-service civilian employment, leveraging the discipline and skills acquired during their military tenure.

Key aspects of the Agnipath scheme, as reiterated during the current drive, include:
*   **Service Duration:** All Agniveers serve for a fixed term of four years.
*   **Retention Rate:** Up to 25% of each Agniveer batch may be selected for regular cadre service after their initial four years.
*   **Financial Package:** A 'Seva Nidhi' exit package is provided to non-retained personnel.
*   **Skill Certification:** Agniveers acquire certified skills during their service, enhancing future career prospects.
*   **Age Criteria:** Typically, candidates between 17.5 and 21 years of age are eligible to apply, with an age relaxation often provided for the first few batches of recruitment.

Looking ahead, the Indian Army's stated intention to significantly increase the intake of Agniveers suggests a sustained commitment to integrating this new personnel model. This planned expansion aims to further rejuvenate the force's demographic profile and solidify the Agnipath model as the primary pathway for entry-level personnel into the armed forces. The ongoing recruitment drives will continue to be a critical component of the Army's human resource strategy, influencing its future operational capabilities and personnel structure.
