New Delhi – Indian Railways has announced a substantial increase in its financial commitment to rail safety, with an allocation of Rs 1.17 lakh crore (1.17 trillion rupees) for the Fiscal Year 2026. This budget represents a tripling of the expenditure dedicated to enhancing safety across the extensive national rail network. The significant investment is primarily earmarked for the accelerated expansion of the indigenous Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, Kavach, and a scaled-up implementation of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance systems.

This heightened financial commitment underscores a strategic focus by Indian Railways on modernizing critical infrastructure and mitigating operational risks. The tripled spending for FY26 aims to bolster passenger security, prevent accidents, and improve overall operational reliability across thousands of kilometers of tracks and numerous stations nationwide. This initiative reflects a sustained effort to integrate advanced technology into core railway functions, moving towards a more robust and secure transportation system.

A central component of this intensified safety drive is the accelerated implementation of Kavach. This ATP system, indigenously developed, is designed to prevent collisions by automatically applying brakes if a train driver fails to respond to critical signals. Kavach also prevents trains from overshooting signals at danger and helps control speeds within specified limits, especially during adverse weather conditions. Its expansion is deemed critical for enhancing signaling integrity and reducing human-related errors across high-density and critical routes.

Simultaneously, the scaled-up deployment of CCTV cameras is set to significantly enhance security and monitoring capabilities throughout the railway ecosystem. These surveillance systems are being installed at railway stations, within passenger coaches, and at vulnerable points along tracks. The footage collected from these cameras is intended to deter criminal activity, aid in incident investigation, and provide real-time monitoring of passenger movement and operational activities, thereby augmenting both safety and security protocols for commuters and railway personnel.

Key details regarding the safety upgrade include:

*   **Financial Commitment:** Rs 1.17 lakh crore allocated for rail safety in Fiscal Year 2026.
*   **Investment Growth:** Expenditure for safety measures has tripled compared to previous periods.
*   **Kavach Expansion:** Continued and accelerated rollout of the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system across additional routes to prevent collisions and improve signal adherence.
*   **CCTV Rollout:** Increased installation of Closed-Circuit Television cameras at more stations and within a greater number of train coaches for enhanced surveillance and security.
*   **Technology Integration:** Emphasis on leveraging advanced and indigenous technologies to improve operational safety and security standards.

Moving forward, the implementation of these extensive safety initiatives is expected to progressively reduce the incidence of railway accidents and enhance passenger confidence in the national rail network. Indian Railways plans to integrate these advanced safety systems into its operational framework over the coming years, alongside continuous monitoring and evaluation of their effectiveness. This substantial, long-term investment signals an ongoing commitment to upgrading safety standards and delivering a more secure travel experience for millions of passengers and for freight operations nationwide.
