Pakistan cricket captain Babar Azam has commented on the emerging controversy surrounding post-match handshakes after the T20 World Cup clash against India. Speaking on Sunday, Azam responded to inquiries about the incident with the remark, "We'll find that out," a statement that has garnered attention amidst ongoing discussions.

The controversy originated following the highly anticipated match between India and Pakistan on June 9 in New York. A video circulated widely across social media platforms showing the customary post-match handshakes between the two teams. While several players from both sides, including Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Rizwan, and Naseem Shah for Pakistan, and some Indian players, engaged in the tradition, certain prominent Indian cricketers, notably Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya, were observed walking past without exchanging handshakes with their Pakistani counterparts.

This perceived omission quickly became a talking point among cricket enthusiasts and commentators. The match itself was a closely contested affair, with India securing a victory by a narrow margin of six runs. The high-stakes nature of the rivalry between the two cricketing nations often amplifies scrutiny of player interactions and sportsmanship.

Babar Azam's recent remark came during a media interaction when pressed on the specifics of the incident. His succinct response, "We'll find that out," has been interpreted by many as a confirmation of awareness regarding the situation, while also suggesting a lack of immediate, public explanation or a pending internal clarification. The captain did not elaborate further on the context or implications of his statement.

The incident has drawn reactions from former players and pundits. Veteran Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram publicly expressed his disappointment regarding the perceived lack of sportsmanship. Akram, a respected voice in international cricket, described the situation as "disappointing," underscoring the importance of post-match camaraderie despite competitive intensity. His comments, alongside those from fellow former cricketer Shoaib Akhtar, have contributed to the ongoing debate about adherence to traditional cricketing courtesies.

As the T20 World Cup progresses, the interaction between the two teams, particularly off the field, will likely continue to be observed closely. While no official statement has been issued by the International Cricket Council (ICC) or either cricket board regarding the incident, the ongoing public discussion highlights the cultural and emotional significance attached to sporting conduct, especially in high-profile international contests. Future matches and potential encounters between India and Pakistan may see increased attention on such interactions, as the sporting community awaits further clarity or resolution on the matter.
