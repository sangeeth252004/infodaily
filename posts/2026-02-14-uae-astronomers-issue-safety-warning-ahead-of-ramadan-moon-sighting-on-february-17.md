Astronomical authorities in the United Arab Emirates have issued a comprehensive safety warning to the public regarding the observation of the crescent moon for Ramadan, specifically ahead of a planned sighting attempt on February 17. The advisory underscores the critical importance of employing correct viewing techniques and certified equipment to prevent severe eye injuries, including permanent blindness.

The crescent moon sighting, known as 'Ruet-e-Hilal,' is a pivotal event in the Islamic calendar, as its confirmation officially marks the commencement of the holy month of Ramadan. Observers often attempt to sight the new moon around sunset, a period during which the sun's direct or reflected glare can pose significant hazards if proper precautions are not taken. The warnings are a proactive measure to safeguard individuals, particularly amateur observers and the general public, from irreversible damage.

Experts from institutions such as the Sharjah Centre for Astronomy and Space Sciences have highlighted the specific dangers associated with directly viewing the sun or observing near the sun's disc without adequate protection. Even momentary exposure to unfiltered sunlight, especially through optical instruments like binoculars or telescopes, can lead to solar retinopathy, a condition causing irreparable damage to the retina. The risk is heightened during sunset hours when the sun's intensity, though seemingly diminished, can still be highly damaging.

The safety guidelines provided by UAE astronomers aim to ensure that the religious and scientific pursuit of moon sighting can be undertaken without compromising personal safety. Key recommendations include:

*   **Never look directly at the sun:** This applies even when the sun appears partially obscured or during sunset.
*   **Utilise certified solar filters:** For telescopes, binoculars, or cameras, only use ISO 12312-2 international safety standard compliant solar filters. These filters must be securely attached to the front of the viewing instrument.
*   **Avoid improvised filters:** Regular sunglasses, smoked glass, exposed film, or uncertified filters do not offer sufficient protection and should never be used for solar observation.
*   **Employ indirect viewing methods:** Techniques such as pinhole projectors or projecting the sun's image onto a white surface are safe alternatives that avoid direct eye exposure.
*   **Seek expert guidance:** For those participating in official or organised moon sighting efforts, adherence to professional astronomers' instructions and use of their specialised equipment is advised.

Following the scheduled observation attempt on February 17, official announcements regarding the start of Ramadan will be made by the relevant religious authorities in the UAE. The emphasis remains on a safe and responsible approach to this significant astronomical and religious event, ensuring that community members can participate without risking their well-being.
