NEW DELHI – The Central Advisory Council (CAC) of the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has highlighted significant non-compliance among state-level real estate regulatory authorities (RERA), with approximately 75% of states and union territories failing to submit their mandatory annual reports. This finding underscores ongoing challenges in the comprehensive implementation and oversight of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, across the nation.

The RERA Act, enacted to bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to the real estate sector, mandates that each state's RERA authority publish annual reports. These reports are crucial for detailing the authority's activities, including project registrations, complaint resolutions, enforcement actions against non-compliant developers, and the overall functioning of the regulatory body. The absence of these reports significantly hinders the ability to assess the Act's effectiveness and monitor the sector's health.

The observation by the CAC, a key advisory body under the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, was made during a recent review of RERA's nationwide implementation. Out of the 28 states and 8 union territories where RERA has been adopted, roughly 27 entities are reportedly not fulfilling their annual reporting obligations. This situation raises concerns about the uniform application of the Act's provisions and the level of transparency maintained by state RERA bodies.

Key details regarding the reporting mandate and its implications include:

*   **Statutory Requirement**: The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, specifically requires state RERA authorities to compile and publish annual reports detailing their operations and the status of the real estate sector within their jurisdiction.
*   **Purpose of Reports**: These documents serve as vital tools for public scrutiny, legislative oversight, and policy formulation, providing data on new project registrations, cancellations, redressal of consumer grievances, and the utilization of project funds.
*   **Central Monitoring**: The non-submission impedes the Central Government's ability to aggregate data and monitor the nationwide impact and performance of RERA, making it difficult to identify areas needing reform or stricter enforcement.
*   **Consumer Impact**: Lack of public reporting can reduce transparency for homebuyers and investors, potentially undermining the confidence that RERA was designed to instill in the real estate market.

The consistent failure of a majority of states and union territories to comply with this fundamental reporting requirement suggests a need for enhanced enforcement mechanisms and standardized reporting protocols. Without comprehensive data, evaluating the success of RERA in achieving its objectives, such as protecting consumers from fraudulent practices and ensuring timely project delivery, becomes challenging.

Moving forward, the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry is expected to intensify its efforts to ensure greater compliance. This may involve urging state governments to prioritize the timely submission of these reports, providing technical assistance to streamline reporting processes, or potentially exploring amendments to strengthen enforcement provisions. The focus will likely be on ensuring that the foundational principles of transparency and accountability, central to the RERA Act, are uniformly upheld across all jurisdictions to safeguard consumer interests in the rapidly evolving real estate market.
