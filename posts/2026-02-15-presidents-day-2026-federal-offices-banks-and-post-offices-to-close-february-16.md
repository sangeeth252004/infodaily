Presidents Day 2026, officially observed on Monday, February 16, will result in the closure of federal government offices, U.S. Postal Service branches, and most financial institutions across the United States. This annual federal holiday will impact a range of public and private sector operations, prompting temporary service interruptions for citizens nationwide.

The holiday, formally known as Washington's Birthday, commemorates the birth of George Washington, the nation's first president. Over time, its observance has evolved to honor all U.S. presidents. Its designation as one of the eleven federal holidays ensures uniform observance across federal entities and institutions regulated at the federal level.

The primary impact of the Presidents Day observance will be felt in government services and the banking sector. All non-essential federal agencies and offices will suspend operations for the day. This includes departments such as the Department of Motor Vehicles in many states, though specific state and local government closures can vary. Federal employees will observe the holiday, and normal business is scheduled to resume the following day.

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will halt all regular mail delivery services on February 16, 2026. Post office retail locations will also be closed to the public. Limited Express Mail services may still operate, but customers are advised to confirm specific details with their local USPS branch. Mail collection from blue street-side collection boxes will also be suspended for the day.

Financial institutions, including commercial banks and credit unions, will largely close their physical branches. While automated teller machines (ATMs) and online banking platforms will remain accessible for transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, any services requiring direct human intervention, such as loan applications or complex customer service inquiries, will be unavailable. Federal Reserve Banks will also be closed, which can affect the processing of interbank transactions and wire transfers until the next business day.

**Key Details Regarding Presidents Day 2026 Closures:**

*   **Federal Government:** All non-essential federal agencies and offices will be closed, affecting administrative services.
*   **U.S. Postal Service:** No regular mail delivery or counter services. Express Mail services may have limited operations.
