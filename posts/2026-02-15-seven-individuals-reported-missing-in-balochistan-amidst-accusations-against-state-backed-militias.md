Seven individuals have been reported missing from multiple districts in Pakistan's Balochistan province, according to activist groups and local political parties. These disappearances, occurring in late October and early November 2022, have prompted accusations against state-backed militias, often referred to as "death squads" by those making the allegations.

The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a prominent advocacy organization, and leaders from the Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) have raised concerns about the incidents. They claim these disappearances are part of a broader pattern of alleged enforced abductions in the region.

The missing individuals were identified across different areas:
*   **Awaran District:** Sanaullah, Bahot Khan, and Haneef were reportedly taken from the Peerandar area.
*   **Panjgur District:** Zahid Baloch was reported missing.
*   **Kech District:** Sanaullah (distinct from the individual missing in Awaran), Balach, and Barkat were also reported as disappeared.

According to statements released by the VBMP, these individuals were allegedly abducted by security forces and associated groups. Families of the missing have reportedly sought information and assistance, but their efforts have not yielded clarity on the whereabouts or status of their relatives.

The allegations concerning "death squads" or "state-backed militias" are not new in Balochistan. Activist groups have consistently claimed that these armed outfits operate with impunity, allegedly targeting political activists, students, human rights defenders, and other civilians suspected of dissenting against the state. These groups are purported to be used to suppress nationalist movements and maintain control in the mineral-rich, yet underdeveloped, province.

Sardar Akhtar Mengal, leader of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal), has previously addressed the issue of enforced disappearances in various forums, including the National Assembly of Pakistan. He has highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by families whose loved ones have gone missing, often without official acknowledgment or legal process.

The reports of disappearances underscore persistent human rights concerns in Balochistan, a region that has experienced a long-running insurgency and subsequent security operations. International human rights organizations have also previously documented cases of alleged enforced disappearances in the province, calling for transparent investigations and accountability.

As of the latest reports, there has been no official statement or acknowledgment from Pakistani authorities regarding the reported disappearances or the allegations made against state-backed militias. Families and activist groups continue to call for the safe recovery of the missing individuals and for an end to what they describe as a policy of enforced disappearances in Balochistan. The fate of the seven individuals remains unknown, intensifying calls for government intervention and independent inquiry.
