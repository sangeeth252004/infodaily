The Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) has issued a comprehensive set of guidelines for candidates preparing to sit for the Class 10 board examinations, which are scheduled to commence tomorrow, February [Day], 2026. These directives aim to ensure the smooth, fair, and transparent conduct of the matriculation exams across various centers throughout Bihar. A significant number of students are expected to participate in this crucial academic assessment that determines their academic progression.

The examinations are organized into two sittings daily. The first sitting is slated from 9:30 AM to 12:45 PM, with the final entry permitted at 9:20 AM. The second sitting will run from 2:00 PM to 5:15 PM, with entry closing strictly at 1:50 PM. Students will be provided an initial 15-minute grace period to read and understand the question paper before they begin writing their answers. This period is intended to help candidates strategize their approach to the paper without immediate pressure to start writing.

Strict adherence to a specified dress code and the prohibition of certain items are central to the board's efforts to prevent malpractices. While no specific uniform has been officially mandated, students are advised to wear simple and appropriate attire. Elaborate clothing, excessive jewelry, and any accessories that could potentially conceal electronic devices are discouraged. The board emphasizes maintaining an environment free from any unfair means to ensure the integrity of the examination process.

To uphold the fairness and integrity of the examination process, the BSEB has outlined a clear list of items that are strictly prohibited inside the examination halls. These measures are standard practice in high-stakes examinations to ensure all candidates compete on an equal footing and prevent any form of cheating.

*   **Prohibited Electronic Devices:** Mobile phones, Bluetooth devices, smartwatches, digital diaries, programmable calculators, and any other electronic gadgets capable of communication or information storage are strictly forbidden inside the examination premises.
*   **Written Material:** Candidates are not permitted to bring any written material, chits, textbooks, notes, or pre-written answers into the examination hall, other than their official admit card.
*   **Other Prohibited Items:** Bags, wallets (other than for carrying the admit card and a valid ID), and any item that could be used for unfair means or to disrupt the examination are also not allowed.

Furthermore, several general guidelines have been established to facilitate an organized examination experience. All students are mandatorily required to carry their official admit card for verification purposes; entry will be denied without it. It is also recommended that candidates carry a valid photo identification card, such as an Aadhaar card, for additional verification if required by invigilators. Students must occupy their designated seats as per their roll numbers and are expected to follow all instructions provided by the examination center staff and invigilators. Any attempt at cheating or engaging in unfair practices will result in immediate disqualification and severe penalties as per BSEB regulations.

The Bihar School Examination Board reiterates its commitment to conducting a fair and transparent examination for all registered students. These guidelines are put in place to ensure a level playing field and to protect the academic integrity of the board examinations. Students are encouraged to familiarize themselves thoroughly with all instructions to avoid any inconvenience or complications on the day of the exam. Following the successful completion of the examinations, the board will proceed with the evaluation process, and results will be announced on dates to be notified subsequently through official channels.
