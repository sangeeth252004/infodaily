The Indian National Congress on October 29, 2022, issued criticism against the Narendra Modi-led government concerning the communication protocol surrounding the Prime Minister's then-upcoming visit to Israel. Congress alleged that information regarding the Prime Minister's foreign engagements frequently surfaced from leaders of host nations before formal announcements were made by the Indian government.

The criticism, as reported by the Times of India, specifically cited the phrase, "'India hears from foreign leaders first'," indicating a perceived lapse in the Modi administration's diplomatic communication strategy. This statement underscored the opposition party's concern over transparency and the timing of official disclosures related to high-profile international visits. While the exact dates and agenda of the anticipated Israel visit were not immediately detailed in the criticism, the remarks were made in anticipation of the Prime Minister's travel plans.

The Congress party's concerns centered on what it described as a pattern where significant diplomatic developments, particularly the Prime Minister's foreign travel, became public knowledge via external sources. This approach, according to Congress, could potentially undermine India's sovereign communication channels and create an impression of reactive rather than proactive foreign policy announcements. Such criticisms are common in the political landscape, where opposition parties often scrutinize government handling of international relations and communication.

Key points of the Congress's criticism included:
*   **Information Dissemination:** The primary contention was that news of PM Modi's international visits often originated from the leaders or official channels of the host countries.
*   **Government Transparency:** The opposition party questioned the transparency and timeliness of the Indian government's own announcements regarding significant diplomatic engagements.
*   **Protocol Adherence:** The comments suggested a deviation from established diplomatic protocols where a nation typically announces its leader's foreign visits first.

Prime Minister Modi previously visited Israel in July 2017, marking the first time an Indian Prime Minister had undertaken such a visit. Subsequent high-level interactions between India and Israel have continued, reflecting evolving strategic and economic ties between the two nations. The Congress's 2022 remarks specifically referred to an *upcoming* visit, highlighting ongoing political scrutiny over how such visits are communicated to the public and international community.

The criticism from the Congress party highlights the broader political discourse in India regarding the government's foreign policy approach and its public communication strategies. While the government did not immediately issue a formal response to these specific allegations, political observers note that such exchanges are part of the ongoing parliamentary and public debate on governance and international relations. The incident underscores the importance placed on official communication and public perception in India's diplomatic engagements.
