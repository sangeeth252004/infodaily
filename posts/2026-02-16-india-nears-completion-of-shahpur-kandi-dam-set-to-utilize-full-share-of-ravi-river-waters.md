India is nearing the completion of the Shahpur Kandi Dam project on the Ravi River, a development poised to enable the nation to fully harness its allocated share of water under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. This infrastructure initiative, located in Punjab’s Gurdaspur district, aims to prevent approximately 1,100 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of Ravi water from flowing downstream into Pakistan, as was previously the case with unutilized water. The project, after facing several delays, is now expected to be commissioned soon, marking a significant step in India’s water resource management.

The Shahpur Kandi Dam project is designed to optimize the water flow from the upstream Ranjit Sagar Dam, generating hydroelectric power and providing irrigation benefits to agricultural lands in both Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir. The dam, situated 11 kilometers downstream of the Ranjit Sagar Dam, includes two powerhouses with a combined generation capacity of 206 megawatts. Its irrigation component is set to provide water for 37,173 hectares of land in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kathua and Samba districts, alongside 5,000 hectares in Punjab. The completion of the dam is aligned with India's long-standing objective to utilize its rightful share of the eastern rivers as stipulated by the Indus Waters Treaty.

*   **Indus Waters Treaty (1960):** This treaty, brokered by the World Bank, divided the waters of the Indus river system between India and Pakistan.
*   **Eastern Rivers:** The Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers were allocated to India for unrestricted use.
*   **Western Rivers:** The Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers were allocated to Pakistan, though India was permitted certain non-consumptive uses and limited irrigation.
*   **Project History:** The Shahpur Kandi Dam project was initially conceived in 1999. Construction began but was halted in 2014 due to disputes between Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir over water sharing and project costs. Work resumed in December 2018 following an agreement facilitated by the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation. The project was declared a national project in 2008 and is overseen by the Punjab Irrigation Department.
*   **Current Status:** Construction has progressed significantly, with key civil works and electro-mechanical installations nearing completion. The dam’s main concrete structure and powerhouse components are largely in place.

The full operationalization of the Shahpur Kandi Dam will allow India to divert and store water that was previously flowing across the border, effectively utilizing the entire 2 million acre-feet (MAF) share of Ravi waters that the treaty allocates to India. This move is consistent with India's stated policy of exercising its full rights over the eastern rivers. The benefits are expected to include enhanced agricultural productivity in the region through assured irrigation, and a boost to the regional power supply.

Upon commissioning, the Shahpur Kandi Dam will represent a culmination of decades of planning and effort to develop water infrastructure on the Ravi River. This development underscores India's focus on national water security and resource optimization within the framework of existing international agreements. The project’s completion is anticipated to provide sustainable water and power resources for the beneficiary states, fulfilling its dual objectives of power generation and irrigation.
