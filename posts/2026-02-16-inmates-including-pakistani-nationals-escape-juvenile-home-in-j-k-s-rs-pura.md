Jammu and Kashmir authorities initiated a comprehensive search operation following the escape of three inmates, including two Pakistani nationals, from an Observation Home located in RS Pura, Jammu. The incident, which occurred on the night of December 21, 2022, has prompted a region-wide alert and raised concerns regarding security protocols at correctional facilities.

The escaped individuals have been identified as Mohammad Reyaz and Mohammad Latief, both Pakistani nationals, and Abdul Muneem, a local Kashmiri. According to official reports, Reyaz and Latief were initially apprehended in 2017 in Kupwara district on charges related to militancy. Abdul Muneem was arrested in 2020 on similar grounds. All three were lodged at the Observation Home as minors at the time of their arrest, though Mohammad Reyaz and Mohammad Latief were reported to be 22 and 23 years old respectively at the time of the escape, with Abdul Muneem being 18. They remained under the jurisdiction of juvenile justice laws due to their age at the time of their original offenses.

The escape was reportedly executed by breaking a window in their room and subsequently scaling the boundary wall of the facility. Upon discovering the breach, staff immediately notified local law enforcement. The Jammu & Kashmir Police, in collaboration with other security forces, swiftly launched a massive manhunt across the region. Checkpoints were established, and public transport hubs were placed under heightened scrutiny as part of the search effort.

The incident highlights a significant security lapse at the Observation Home, which is designated for the care and rehabilitation of young offenders. The involvement of individuals with a history of militancy-related charges, particularly foreign nationals, has escalated the gravity of the situation. Authorities are currently reviewing the security infrastructure and operational procedures of the facility to prevent future occurrences. An internal investigation has commenced to ascertain the exact circumstances leading to the escape and to identify any potential negligence.

As of the latest reports, the search operation remains active and ongoing. Authorities have appealed to the public to provide any relevant information that could assist in the apprehension of the escaped inmates, while cautioning against direct engagement. The incident underscores the continuous challenges in maintaining secure correctional environments, particularly in sensitive regions.
