The National Testing Agency (NTA), responsible for conducting the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main, has detailed the standardized methodology for calculating candidate ranks, a process applicable to the upcoming 2026 examination cycle. This system is designed to convert candidates' raw scores into percentile scores, which then form the basis for the final All India Ranks (AIRs) for admission to various undergraduate engineering programs across India.

The primary reason for adopting a percentile-based system is to ensure fairness and equity across multiple examination sessions. JEE Main is typically conducted over several shifts and days, each utilizing different sets of question papers. Raw scores alone cannot be directly compared across these varied sessions due to potential differences in difficulty levels. The percentile system normalizes these scores, providing a relative measure of a candidate's performance compared to all others who appeared in the same examination session. This normalization is critical for establishing a level playing field.

A candidate's NTA Score, or percentile score, indicates the percentage of candidates who have scored equal to or below that particular candidate in their respective examination session. This score is calculated independently for each subject (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) as well as for the overall raw score across all subjects. The formula for calculating the percentile score for a specific session is as follows:

*   **Percentile Score = (100 * Number of candidates appeared in the session with a raw score EQUAL TO or LESS THAN the candidate's raw score) / (Total number of candidates who appeared in that session)**

This calculation is performed independently for each shift and day of the examination. The highest percentile score obtained by a candidate across all sessions in which they appeared is then considered their final NTA Score. It is important to note that the NTA Score is not the same as the percentage of marks obtained; rather, it represents a relative position within the candidate's examination group.

The final All India Ranks are then prepared by merging the NTA Scores of all candidates across all examination sessions. In instances where two or more candidates secure the same NTA Score (overall percentile), the NTA employs a specific set of tie-breaking rules to determine their relative ranks. These rules are applied sequentially until a unique rank is established:

*   Candidates with a higher NTA Score in Mathematics are given preference.
*   If the tie persists, candidates with a higher NTA Score in Physics are ranked higher.
*   Should the tie still remain, candidates with a higher NTA Score in Chemistry are prioritized.
*   Following subject-specific scores, candidates with a lesser proportion of negative responses (incorrect answers) in the overall examination are ranked higher.
*   If a tie still exists, the candidate older in age is given preference.
*   Finally, if all previous criteria fail to break the tie, candidates are ranked according to their application number in ascending order.

This transparent and multi-faceted rank calculation process is crucial for hundreds of thousands of aspirants seeking admission to National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs), and for eligibility to appear in JEE Advanced for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). The NTA will release the official NTA Scores and subsequent All India Ranks following the completion of the JEE Main 2026 examination cycles, enabling eligible candidates to proceed with the joint seat allocation and admission processes.
