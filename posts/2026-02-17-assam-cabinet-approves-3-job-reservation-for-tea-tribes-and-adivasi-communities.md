Guwahati, Assam – The Assam state cabinet has formally approved a three percent reservation in Grade 1 and Grade 2 government jobs for the state's tea garden tribes and Adivasi communities. The decision, made during a cabinet meeting in early August 2022, is designed to enhance the representation of these historically marginalized groups within the state’s public administration and address long-standing socio-economic disparities.

This significant policy shift represents a dedicated effort by the Assam government to provide increased access to public employment opportunities for communities that have traditionally faced systemic disadvantages. The reservation specifically targets positions within the higher echelons of state administration, which encompass various senior managerial, technical, and administrative roles. Grade 1 and Grade 2 jobs typically include roles such as Assistant Commissioners, Executive Engineers, medical officers, and other Gazetted officer positions, where the representation from the tea garden tribes and Adivasis has historically been disproportionately low.

For generations, the tea garden tribes, often collectively referred to as Adivasis in Assam, have contended with unique socio-economic challenges. These include issues stemming from their historical migration during the British colonial era, often resulting in landlessness, limited access to quality education, lower literacy rates, and constrained public services. Descendants of communities brought to Assam from various parts of central India in the 19th and early 20th centuries to work in tea plantations, these groups have largely remained socio-economically vulnerable.

While many members of these communities were already categorized under Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and benefited from existing reservation policies, this new three percent quota provides a specific and distinct pathway to government employment tailored for them. This focused affirmative action is anticipated to facilitate greater inclusion and upward mobility, potentially impacting thousands of eligible individuals over the coming years by enabling them to secure influential positions within the state bureaucracy.

Key aspects of the cabinet's decision include:
*   The three percent reservation is exclusively applicable to Grade 1 and Grade 2 categories of state government services.
*   This new quota is intended to supplement, rather than replace, existing reservation policies for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other existing Other Backward Classes.
*   The policy targets the specific lineage of Adivasi communities who were originally brought to Assam by British colonialists for labor in the burgeoning tea industry.
*   The government's stated objective is to ensure more equitable representation across all levels of public administration and to empower these communities socially and economically, integrating them more fully into mainstream governance.

Following the cabinet's approval, the state's Department of Personnel is expected to proceed with drafting the necessary amendments to relevant recruitment rules and issue official notifications for the implementation of this new reservation policy. The execution of this policy will be closely observed by various stakeholders, including community leaders and civil society organizations, as its effectiveness in achieving the stated goals of enhanced representation and upliftment for the tea garden tribes and Adivasi communities across Assam unfolds. This step is part of broader efforts to foster inclusive governance within the state.
