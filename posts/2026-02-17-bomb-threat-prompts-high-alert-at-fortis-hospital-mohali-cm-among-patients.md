MOHALI, PUNJAB – Fortis Hospital Mohali was placed on high alert on November 16, 2022, following the reception of an email threatening a bomb blast. The incident prompted a comprehensive security response involving local police, bomb disposal squads, and canine units, initiating extensive search operations across the hospital premises and nearby educational institutions. Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann was reportedly receiving treatment at the hospital for a stomach ailment at the time of the threat.

The threatening email was received by the hospital management, triggering immediate activation of emergency protocols. Mohali Police swiftly arrived at the scene, establishing a perimeter and commencing a detailed sweep of the multi-story facility. The presence of the Chief Minister added an additional layer of security concern to the already serious situation, although official sources maintained his condition was stable and unrelated to the threat. Hospital operations continued with heightened vigilance, prioritizing patient safety while the search was underway.

Security personnel, including members of the bomb disposal squad and trained dog squads, meticulously examined various departments, patient wards, administrative blocks, and parking areas within the hospital complex. Simultaneously, nearby schools were also brought under increased scrutiny as a precautionary measure, reflecting the broad scope of the security response. The disruption caused by the incident affected staff, patients, and visitors, many of whom faced restricted movement and increased security checks.

Approximately two hours after the threat was received, following a thorough search that yielded no suspicious devices or materials, Mohali Police officially declared the bomb threat a hoax. Initial assessments by authorities suggested the email might have been part of an extortion attempt. The declaration allowed for a gradual return to normal operations, although a sense of heightened awareness persisted among staff and the public.
