India's External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar recently articulated a stark assessment of the current international landscape, stating that the global order is progressing towards a "twilight zone." He characterized this emerging environment as "messy, risky, and dangerous," underscoring significant challenges to established international norms and stability.

Jaishankar’s remarks highlight a period of profound flux in global affairs, where traditional frameworks and certainties are increasingly under strain. The description of a "twilight zone" suggests an intermediate state, moving away from a known order without a clear path to a new, defined structure. This transition, as outlined by the Minister, is marked by unpredictability and heightened geopolitical tensions across various regions.

The Minister's comments were made during a public address where he elaborated on the complexities facing international diplomacy and security. His assessment pointed to several contributing factors to this perceived instability:

*   **Geopolitical Volatility:** An increase in regional conflicts and heightened tensions among major global powers.
*   **Economic Uncertainties:** Persistent global economic disparities, supply chain disruptions, and the weaponization of economic policies.
*   **Challenges to Multilateralism:** A weakening of international institutions and a decline in consensus-based approaches to global issues.
*   **Erosion of Trust:** A perceived decrease in trust between nations, leading to more competitive and less cooperative international relations.
*   **Emergence of New Power Dynamics:** The rise of multiple power centres and the re-evaluation of historical alliances and partnerships.

Jaishankar emphasized that these converging factors are creating an environment where traditional diplomatic tools and strategies may prove insufficient. The "messy, risky, dangerous" descriptor points to the potential for miscalculation and escalation in a global system that lacks clear rules or reliable anchors. He noted the increasing difficulty in anticipating events and managing their cascading effects across borders, impacting areas from trade and technology to security and human rights.

The Minister's statements reflect India's perspective on the rapidly evolving global scenario, positioning the country to navigate these complexities through a pragmatic and multi-aligned foreign policy. India, as a major developing economy and a significant voice in the Global South, often advocates for reformed multilateralism and a more equitable international order. Jaishankar’s warning serves as a call for strategic vigilance and adaptive diplomacy from nations worldwide.

The pronouncement by EAM Jaishankar signals a recognition within India's foreign policy establishment that the global environment is undergoing fundamental shifts. It suggests a proactive approach to understanding and addressing the implications of a less predictable world order, advocating for resilience and strategic autonomy in international engagements as the world continues to grapple with these evolving challenges. The full implications of this "twilight zone" will likely continue to be a central focus of international discourse and diplomatic efforts in the foreseeable future.
