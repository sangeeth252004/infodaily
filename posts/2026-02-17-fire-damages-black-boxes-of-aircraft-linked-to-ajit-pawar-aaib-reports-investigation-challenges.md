The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has confirmed that both the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) of a Pilatus PC-12 aircraft were severely damaged by fire following a hard landing incident in June 2022. The single-engine turboprop aircraft, bearing registration VT-JSP, was reportedly hired by Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, though he was not onboard at the time of the incident. The damage to these crucial "black boxes" presents significant challenges for investigators attempting to determine the precise cause of the accident.

The incident occurred on June 24, 2022, when the aircraft executed a hard landing at a private airstrip near Uruli Kanchan in the Pune district of Maharashtra. Following the impact, a fire erupted, engulfing parts of the aircraft and causing extensive damage. The pilot, Captain Anjali Soni, and an engineer who were the sole occupants, managed to exit the aircraft safely with minor injuries. While black boxes are designed to withstand significant impact and fire, the extent of the blaze in this instance compromised their integrity, making data retrieval difficult or potentially impossible.

The AAIB, the primary investigative agency for civil aviation accidents and serious incidents in India, immediately launched a comprehensive inquiry into the event. The agency's preliminary assessment revealed the severe impact of the fire on the recording devices.

Key details regarding the incident and investigation include:
*   **Aircraft Type:** Pilatus PC-12, a single-engine turboprop aircraft.
*   **Registration:** VT-JSP.
*   **Incident Date:** June 24, 2022.
*   **Location:** Private airstrip near Uruli Kanchan, Pune district, Maharashtra.
*   **Outcome:** Hard landing followed by fire; pilot and engineer escaped with minor injuries.
*   **Recorders Damaged:** Both the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) sustained severe fire damage.
*   **Investigative Body:** Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB).

The damage to the FDR, which records parameters such as airspeed, altitude, heading, engine performance, and control surface positions, typically provides a detailed timeline of the aircraft's operational state before an incident. Similarly, the CVR captures all sounds within the cockpit, including conversations between pilots, air traffic control communications, and ambient noises, offering critical insights into crew actions and situational awareness. The compromised state of both recorders means investigators may be deprived of the most direct and reliable evidence to reconstruct the final moments of the flight. The AAIB will now likely rely more heavily on alternative sources of evidence, including eyewitness accounts, ground impact analysis, wreckage examination, air traffic control transcripts, and maintenance records. The investigation remains ongoing, with the AAIB working to piece together the events despite the significant data limitations. The final report is anticipated to detail the challenges encountered and any conclusions drawn from the available evidence.
