The Haryana Special Task Force (STF) has successfully apprehended two Pakistani youths in Sonepat who had recently escaped from a juvenile observation home in Jammu.

Their escape prompted an extensive search operation by law enforcement agencies across multiple states.

Acting on specific intelligence, a unit of the Haryana STF successfully tracked down and apprehended the two youths in the Sonepat district. The operation highlights inter-state coordination in addressing security and law enforcement challenges. The STF is currently coordinating with Jammu and Kashmir Police to facilitate the next steps in their custody and legal process.
