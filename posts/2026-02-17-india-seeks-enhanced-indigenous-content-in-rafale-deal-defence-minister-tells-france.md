India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh recently called on France to significantly increase the "India-made component" in ongoing and future defence procurement agreements, specifically referencing the multi-billion-euro Rafale fighter jet deal. The statement, made during interactions with French defence industry leaders and government officials, underscores India's strategic push for greater indigenization in its defence sector.

The appeal comes in the context of India's acquisition of 36 Rafale multi-role fighter jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, a deal valued at approximately €7.8 billion (approximately $8.7 billion USD), signed in September 2016. Deliveries of these aircraft commenced in 2020 and concluded in late 2022, significantly enhancing the Indian Air Force's operational capabilities. Singh's renewed emphasis reflects a broader governmental directive to integrate Indian manufacturing and technological capabilities more deeply into international defence partnerships.

This initiative is a cornerstone of India's 'Make in India' and 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) campaigns, aimed at transforming the nation into a global manufacturing hub and reducing its substantial reliance on foreign military imports. By fostering increased local content in critical defence platforms like the Rafale, India seeks to achieve several strategic objectives:

*   **Boost Domestic Manufacturing:** Encouraging foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to source components and sub-systems from Indian industries.
*   **Technology Transfer and Absorption:** Facilitating the transfer of advanced technologies and expertise to Indian defence public sector undertakings and private firms.
*   **Job Creation:** Generating employment opportunities for skilled personnel within India's aerospace and defence sectors.
*   **Enhance Maintenance and Support:** Building indigenous capabilities for the lifetime maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) of sophisticated defence equipment, thereby reducing turnaround times and costs.
*   **Strengthen Supply Chains:** Diversifying and localizing critical defence supply chains, enhancing national security resilience.

During his interactions, Minister Singh conveyed that India prioritizes partnerships that include substantive transfer of technology and promote local manufacturing, moving beyond a simple buyer-seller relationship. The focus is on co-development and co-production models that leverage India's growing industrial base and engineering talent.

Looking ahead, future defence procurement agreements and strategic collaborations between India and France are expected to incorporate this emphasis on indigenization as a core tenet. Discussions between the two nations are anticipated to explore specific avenues for French defence companies to invest further in India, establish manufacturing facilities, and integrate Indian suppliers into their global production ecosystems, aligning with India's long-term vision for achieving comprehensive self-sufficiency in defence production.
