Dhaka, Bangladesh – Tarique Rahman was officially sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Bangladesh on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at a ceremony held at Bangabhaban, the official residence of the President. The oath of office was administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, formalizing Mr. Rahman's assumption of leadership following a recent parliamentary election. The event marks a significant political transition in the South Asian nation.

The swearing-in ceremony was attended by a range of dignitaries, including members of the newly elected parliament, high-ranking government officials, foreign diplomats, and prominent figures from various sectors. Mr. Rahman, aged 57, pledged to uphold the Constitution and serve the people of Bangladesh with integrity during his tenure. His appointment signals a new chapter in Bangladesh's political landscape, concluding the previous administration's term.

Mr. Rahman, who serves as the acting chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), returns to direct governance after years primarily operating from abroad. He is the eldest son of former President Ziaur Rahman and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, both prominent figures in Bangladesh's political history. His return to the country in early April, following a period of self-imposed exile, preceded a robust election campaign that culminated in his party securing a majority in the April 28 general elections.

The new Prime Minister is expected to address several key areas immediately. During his initial remarks, Mr. Rahman outlined several priorities for his administration:

*   **Economic Stability:** Focus on controlling inflation, boosting foreign investment, and fostering sustainable economic growth.
*   **Governance Reform:** Commitment to strengthening democratic institutions, ensuring accountability, and enhancing public service delivery.
*   **Social Welfare:** Plans to expand social safety nets, improve access to education and healthcare, and create employment opportunities for youth.
*   **Foreign Policy:** Reaffirmation of Bangladesh's commitment to regional peace and cooperation, while seeking to enhance bilateral ties with international partners.

The formation of Mr. Rahman's cabinet is anticipated in the coming days, with initial announcements expected by the end of the week. This new cabinet will be tasked with translating the government's outlined priorities into concrete policies and programs. Political observers are closely watching the initial policy decisions and the composition of the new government, anticipating their impact on Bangladesh's domestic and international standing. The parliament is scheduled to convene its first session under the new leadership in early June to begin legislative work.
