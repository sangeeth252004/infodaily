Philadelphia, PA – The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and its graduate employees union, GET-UP/GEOC-UAW Local 2710, have reached a tentative agreement, successfully averting a strike that was set to begin [specific date, e.g., October 26th] if a deal was not finalized. The breakthrough concludes over a year of intensive bargaining between the university administration and the union representing approximately 3,000 graduate student workers.

The agreement marks a significant development for both the university community and its graduate workforce. Graduate students serve critical roles across the institution as teaching assistants, research assistants, and instructors, contributing substantially to undergraduate education and groundbreaking research initiatives. A strike would have led to widespread disruptions in classes, research labs, and various campus services, impacting thousands of students and faculty members.

Negotiations commenced in [approximate date one year ago, e.g., late 2022] following the union's certification. Key demands from GET-UP/GEOC-UAW Local 2710 throughout the bargaining period included improved compensation, comprehensive healthcare benefits, enhanced grievance procedures, and robust protections against harassment and discrimination. The union had previously authorized a strike vote, signaling its readiness to take industrial action if a satisfactory agreement could not be reached by their set deadline.

University administration officials had consistently expressed their commitment to reaching a fair and equitable agreement that recognized the vital contributions of graduate students while maintaining the university's operational stability. The tentative nature of the deal indicates that while an agreement has been struck at the bargaining table, it still requires formal approval from union members.

Details of the tentative agreement, which are expected to be fully disclosed following the ratification process, reportedly include:
*   **Competitive Wage Increases:** A multi-year plan for salary adjustments for all graduate student workers.
*   **Enhanced Healthcare Coverage:** Improved health insurance benefits, potentially including expanded dental and vision coverage, and reduced out-of-pocket costs.
*   **Robust Grievance Procedures:** Clearer, more accessible processes for addressing workplace disputes and concerns.
*   **Anti-Discrimination and Harassment Protections:** Strengthened language and mechanisms to protect graduate workers from various forms of discrimination and harassment.
*   **Parental Leave Benefits:** Expanded and improved provisions for parental and family leave.

The tentative agreement will now proceed to GET-UP/GEOC-UAW Local 2710 members for a ratification vote. If ratified, this will establish the first collective bargaining agreement for graduate student workers at the University of Pennsylvania, setting a significant precedent for labor relations in higher education and potentially influencing similar organizing efforts at peer institutions nationwide. The ratification process is expected to occur in the coming weeks, after which the full terms of the agreement will be publicly accessible.
