The Indian National Congress party in Assam has recently responded to circulating reports regarding the potential departure of its state unit president, Bhupen Borah. Amid these internal challenges, party spokespersons also issued a controversial statement directed at Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and alleged the presence of "confidential leaks" within the organization.

Sources within the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) have actively sought to downplay the rumors concerning Mr. Borah’s potential exit, categorizing them as unfounded and an attempt to create instability within the party. Mr. Borah, a prominent figure in the state Congress, has been serving as the APCC President, leading the party's efforts in Assam. The party's official stance emphasizes that Mr. Borah remains committed to his role and the party's agenda in the state.

In a related development that has intensified political discourse, a spokesperson for the Congress party made a contentious statement, referring to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma as "Assam's Jinnah." The comparison draws upon Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, a figure associated with the partition of India in 1947, and is widely regarded as a highly provocative and critical political epithet in the Indian context, often implying divisive leadership. This statement underscores the heightened political animosity between the opposition Congress and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Assam.

Further complicating the political situation, the Congress leadership has also formally alleged the occurrence of "confidential leaks" from within the party's internal communications. Party officials claim these leaks are deliberate and orchestrated to fuel internal discord and propagate false narratives, particularly regarding the status and intentions of key leaders like Mr. Borah. The allegations suggest a targeted effort to undermine the party's cohesion and public image at a critical juncture.

The series of events highlights a period of significant internal and external pressure for the Congress party in Assam. The party is contending with reports of leadership uncertainty while simultaneously engaging in sharp political exchanges with the state's incumbent government.

*   **Leadership Status:** Bhupen Borah continues to hold the position of Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President.
*   **Allegation of Leaks:** The Congress attributes the spread of internal rumors to deliberate "confidential leaks."
*   **Controversial Remark:** Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma was publicly labeled "Assam's Jinnah" by a Congress spokesperson.

These developments signal an period of intensified political rhetoric and scrutiny within Assam's political landscape. Observers anticipate further responses from the ruling BJP regarding the controversial "Jinnah" comment, as well as continued efforts by the Congress to consolidate its internal unity and counter alleged destabilization efforts. The political implications of these incidents are expected to resonate as parties prepare for upcoming electoral cycles in the region.
