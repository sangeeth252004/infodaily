Galgotias University management has issued a public apology, attributing a recent viral video involving a robotic dog to a professor’s "enthusiasm of being on camera." The institution clarified that the project showcased was a "hobby-based project" and not an official university innovation or research initiative. The statement aims to address the widespread discussion and scrutiny that followed the video's circulation across social media platforms.

The controversy began when a video featuring a professor from Galgotias University presenting a robotic dog gained significant traction online. The presentation, which suggested the robot was an institutional achievement, led to public debate and questions regarding the authenticity and origin of the technology, with many observers noting similarities to commercially available robotic platforms such as Boston Dynamics' Spot or models from manufacturers like Unitree.

In its official communication, Galgotias University stated it wanted to "profusely apologise for the unwanted controversy." The university asserted that the professor’s actions misrepresented the nature of the project. According to the university's statement, the professor's "enthusiasm of being on camera" led to the presentation of a "hobby-based project as an innovation." This explanation sought to distance the university from claims that had been perceived as official institutional advancements.

Key details from the university's response include:
*   **Official Apology:** The university conveyed a "profuse apology" for the incident and the resulting public discourse.
*   **Blame Attribution:** The institution explicitly cited the professor's "enthusiasm of being on camera" as the reason for the misrepresentation.
*   **Project Classification:** The robotic dog was categorized as a "hobby-based project," underscoring that it was developed independently by the professor.
*   **Disclaimer of Official Status:** Galgotias University confirmed the project was "not a university project or innovation," clarifying it was neither funded nor sanctioned as official university research.
*   **Commitment to Accuracy:** The university emphasized its dedication to "accuracy and responsibility" in all public communications and presentations.

The incident highlights the growing scrutiny placed on academic institutions regarding technological claims, particularly in an era where digital content can rapidly go viral. The university's swift response reflects an effort to manage its public image and uphold its academic reputation in the wake of the controversy. Educational bodies frequently face the challenge of distinguishing between individual faculty pursuits and officially endorsed institutional advancements, especially when those pursuits enter the public domain through social media.

Moving forward, the university is expected to reinforce internal guidelines and protocols for faculty members regarding the public presentation of projects. This measure would aim to ensure that all academic showcases accurately represent their origin, funding, and official status, thereby preventing future misunderstandings. The institution's actions underscore a broader institutional need for clear communication and verification processes when engaging with the public about technological developments.
