Leaders from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition in Bihar have urged Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to reconsider the state's stringent liquor prohibition policy. The calls for a review cite significant financial losses, a surge in illicit alcohol trade, and an overburdened judicial system since the ban's implementation in April 2016.

Among those advocating for a re-evaluation is Jitan Ram Manjhi, founder of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) (HAM-S), a key NDA ally. Manjhi publicly stated the need for the government to review the ban, emphasizing its adverse economic and social impacts. Similar sentiments have been expressed by leaders within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), also part of the ruling coalition in Bihar.

The prohibition, enacted on April 5, 2016, aimed to improve public health and reduce crime. However, critics within the NDA now argue that the policy has led to unintended consequences.

Key concerns raised by the allies include:

*   **Significant Financial Losses:** Estimates suggest the state is losing approximately ₹20,000 crore annually in potential excise revenue. This revenue, they argue, could be utilized for development projects and public welfare initiatives.
*   **Rise of Illicit Liquor:** The ban has inadvertently fueled a robust black market for alcohol, leading to an increase in the production and sale of spurious liquor. This illicit trade has resulted in numerous fatalities across the state, posing a serious public health challenge.
*   **Judicial Overburden:** Bihar's courts are reportedly overwhelmed with cases related to prohibition violations. More than 4 lakh cases linked to the liquor ban are currently pending, placing immense strain on the state's judicial resources and contributing to backlogs.
*   **Impact on Tourism and Hospitality:** Concerns have also been raised regarding the ban's negative impact on Bihar's tourism sector and hospitality industry, potentially deterring visitors and investments.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has consistently defended the prohibition policy, often highlighting its positive social impact and asserting strong support from a significant section of the population, particularly women. Despite this, the unified calls from within his own ruling alliance represent a notable political pressure point.

As the debate continues, the Chief Minister's office has not indicated any immediate plans to revoke or significantly alter the policy. The ongoing discussion within the NDA coalition underscores the complex challenges associated with implementing and enforcing statewide prohibition, keeping the future of Bihar's liquor ban under intense scrutiny.
