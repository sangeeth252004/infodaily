**Ahmedabad, India** – The National Institute of Design (NID) has officially announced the examination dates for the Design Aptitude Test (DAT) 2026 Mains, a crucial stage for admission to its Bachelor of Design (B.Des) and Master of Design (M.Des) programs. The announcement, released on December 4, 2024, provides a detailed schedule for the second phase of the entrance examination process, following the successful completion of the DAT Prelims.

The NID DAT is a two-stage examination designed to assess the aptitude of candidates aspiring to pursue design education at one of India's premier design institutions. The DAT Prelims, a written examination, serves as the initial screening stage, with only shortlisted candidates proceeding to the DAT Mains. This second stage typically involves studio tests, interviews, and portfolio reviews, varying by program and campus. The release of the Mains schedule allows eligible candidates to prepare for these practical assessments and plan their next steps in the competitive admission cycle.

The NID DAT 2026 Mains examination will be conducted across various designated centers. Candidates are advised to refer to the official NID admissions portal, admissions.nid.edu, for precise venue details and any further updates. The DAT Mains is instrumental in the final selection process, contributing significantly to the overall merit score for admission to NID's seven campuses, including Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Bengaluru, and the new campuses in Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, and Assam.
