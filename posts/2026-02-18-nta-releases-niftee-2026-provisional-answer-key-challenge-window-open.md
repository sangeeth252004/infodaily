The National Testing Agency (NTA) has officially released the provisional answer key for the National Institute of Fashion Technology Entrance Examination (NIFTEE) 2026. Candidates who participated in the examination can now access this key on the NTA's official website, nta.ac.in. The release of the provisional key initiates a designated period during which candidates are permitted to review the provided answers and submit challenges against any discrepancies they identify.

This provisional release is a standard procedural step in competitive examinations administered by the NTA. It aims to foster transparency and provide candidates with an opportunity to verify the accuracy of the marked responses before the final answer key and subsequent examination results are officially declared. The NIFTEE serves as a crucial entrance examination for aspirants seeking admission to various undergraduate and postgraduate programs offered by the National Institutes of Fashion Technology (NIFT) located across India.

To access the provisional answer key, candidates are required to log in to the specific portal on nta.ac.in using their unique application number and date of birth. Upon successful login, they can view the examination question paper along with the corresponding provisional answers. The established process for challenging specific questions or answers typically involves providing clear justification and, where necessary, supporting documentation. While the direct announcement did not specify a fee, NTA's standard procedure for challenging provisional answer keys generally includes a non-refundable processing fee per challenged question. This mechanism is designed to ensure that challenges are submitted after careful consideration.

*   **Official Website:** nta.ac.in
*   **Examination:** National Institute of Fashion Technology Entrance Examination (NIFTEE) 2026
*   **Key Type:** Provisional Answer Key
*   **Purpose:** Candidate review and submission of objections
*   **Access Method:** Login using application number and date of birth
*   **Subsequent Steps:** Expert review of challenges, release of final answer key, followed by result declaration.

The window for submitting challenges to the provisional answer key is time-bound, and candidates are advised to adhere strictly to the specified deadline. Following the conclusion of the challenge period, a dedicated panel of subject matter experts, appointed by the NTA, will meticulously review all valid objections submitted by candidates. Based on this comprehensive review, any necessary revisions will be incorporated into the answer key. This revised and confirmed key will then be published as the final answer key. This final key serves as the definitive reference for the evaluation of candidate responses and the accurate calculation of scores.

Subsequent to the publication of the final answer key, the NTA will proceed with the official declaration of the NIFTEE 2026 results. These results will include individual candidate scores and ranks, which are fundamental for the subsequent counseling and admission processes for NIFT programs. The entire process, from the initial provisional key release to the final result declaration, is designed to uphold fairness and accuracy within the competitive examination framework. Candidates are encouraged to regularly monitor the official NTA website for any further updates and notifications pertinent to the NIFTEE 2026 examination cycle.
