In late October 2022, Pakistan's vice-captain Shadab Khan publicly addressed critical remarks made by former national cricketers, including Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Yousuf. Khan asserted that the current Pakistan squad had achieved a significant milestone by defeating India in a World Cup match, a feat he implied had eluded previous generations of Pakistani cricketers. His comments emerged amidst ongoing discussions and analyses of the national team's performance within the cricketing community.

Khan's remarks directly addressed what he perceived as undue criticism from former players. He specifically highlighted Pakistan's historic 10-wicket victory over India during the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup in Dubai. This win marked Pakistan's first-ever triumph against India in any ICC World Cup event, breaking a long-standing streak of defeats across both 50-over and T20 formats. The all-rounder's statement, "We have beaten India once [in a World Cup], unlike our ex-cricketers," underscored a perceived generational divide and a defensive stance against the veterans' critique.

The comments followed earlier statements by Shahid Afridi, who had reportedly criticized aspects of the current team's captaincy and overall performance. Afridi, a prominent former captain and all-rounder, had publicly expressed his views on the team's dynamics, contributing to a broader public debate within Pakistani cricket circles. Mohammad Yousuf, another former captain and prolific batsman, had also been vocal with his analyses of the team's structure and strategy.

Shadab Khan emphasized that the team remained unified and focused on its objectives, despite external pressures. He suggested that external commentary, particularly from former players, could potentially disrupt team morale rather than provide constructive support. The vice-captain's assertion aimed to redirect focus towards the team's achievements and future goals rather than dwell on historical shortcomings or contemporary criticisms.

Supporting details:
*   **Context of criticism:** Remarks by former players like Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Yousuf frequently centered on aspects such as team selection, captaincy decisions, and overall tactical approaches.
*   **Historic victory:** Pakistan's 10-wicket win against India in the 2021 T20 World Cup was achieved on October 24, 2021, at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. It featured significant performances from captain Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, who both scored unbeaten half-centuries in pursuit of India's total of 151.
*   **Shadab Khan's role:** As vice-captain, Khan's public statement carried significant weight, representing a senior player's perspective on internal team dynamics and external scrutiny.

This public exchange highlighted the ongoing scrutiny and high expectations placed upon the Pakistan national cricket team, particularly concerning its performance against arch-rival India. The comments from both current and former players underscored the passion and intensity surrounding cricket in the region. At the time, the team was preparing for subsequent matches in international tournaments, with the focus remaining on delivering consistent performances on the field despite the off-field discussions. The incident served as a reminder of the complex relationship between past legends and present-day cricketers within the highly competitive landscape of international cricket.
