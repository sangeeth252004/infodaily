Sourav Ganguly, former President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and a prominent figure in international cricket, recently voiced his support for an appeal concerning former Pakistani captain and Prime Minister Imran Khan. Ganguly emphasized that Khan "must be looked after and respected," a statement widely reported on December 31, 2022, amidst ongoing political developments surrounding Khan in Pakistan.

The statement by Ganguly, a contemporary of Khan during their respective playing careers, underscored a sentiment within the global cricketing fraternity regarding the welfare and recognition of one of the sport's most iconic figures. At the time of the statement, Imran Khan, who led Pakistan to their only Cricket World Cup victory in 1992, was facing significant political and legal challenges following his ousting from the Prime Minister's office in April 2022. The appeal Ganguly backed reportedly sought to highlight Khan's immense contributions to both cricket and his nation, advocating for fair treatment and acknowledgment of his legacy.

Ganguly, who captained India in 49 Tests and 147 One Day Internationals, held the influential position of BCCI President from October 2019 until October 2022, succeeding C.K. Khanna and later succeeded by Roger Binny. His public comments, even as a former administrator, carry considerable weight within sports and diplomatic circles, particularly given the historical cricketing rivalry and complex political relationship between India and Pakistan. The backing of such an appeal by a figure of Ganguly's stature signals a cross-border professional reverence that often transcends geopolitical differences.

Key aspects surrounding the appeal and Ganguly's statement include:

*   **Imran Khan's Legacy:** Khan is celebrated as one of cricket's greatest all-rounders and a transformative captain, remembered for his leadership in the 1992 World Cup. His subsequent entry into politics saw him found the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, eventually becoming Prime Minister in 2018.
*   **Political Context:** The statement emerged during a period of heightened political instability in Pakistan, characterized by widespread protests, legal proceedings, and calls for early elections following Khan's removal from power through a no-confidence vote.
*   **Cricketing Fraternity:** The appeal reflects a tradition within the international cricketing community to offer support and solidarity to its members, particularly those who have achieved legendary status, regardless of their current political circumstances or national allegiances.
*   **Sourav Ganguly's Standing:** As a former captain and administrator, Ganguly's words resonate globally, symbolizing a shared respect for cricketing heroes across national boundaries.

The emphasis on Khan being "looked after and respected" by Ganguly highlighted a concern for the dignity and well-being of a former national leader and sports icon amidst a tumultuous period in his public life. While not delving into the specifics of Pakistani internal politics, Ganguly's message underscored the enduring bonds and mutual regard that can exist within the sports community. The appeal and subsequent backing by prominent figures like Ganguly serve as a reminder of Khan's significant contributions and the call for his respectful treatment, as voiced by the global cricketing brotherhood.
