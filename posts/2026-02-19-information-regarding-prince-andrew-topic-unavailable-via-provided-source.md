This response addresses the user's request to write a factual news article with the title "Britain's ex-prince Andrew arrested over misconduct amid Epstein row," citing an official company announcement via the URL `https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britains-ex-prince-andrew-arrested-over-misconduct-amid-epstein-row/articleshow/128552441.cms`.

Upon attempting to access the provided Uniform Resource Locator (URL), it was found to lead to a page stating, "This story is no longer available. You may have found it on a search engine, or it may have been removed." Consequently, the central claim of the requested article—that Prince Andrew was arrested over misconduct amid the Epstein row—cannot be verified through the designated source.

As a professional news journalist, adherence to factual reporting and objective verification is paramount. Producing an article about an alleged arrest without verifiable information from a credible source would violate journalistic standards, which mandate accuracy, impartiality, and the avoidance of speculation or unsupported statements. The instructions explicitly prohibit the generation of false claims or information lacking a verified source, particularly concerning individuals, to prevent unfair accusations or defamation.

Without access to the original content at the specified URL, or any other verifiable official company announcement confirming an arrest, it is not possible to fulfill the request to write a factual news article on this specific topic. The integrity of news reporting relies entirely on the ability to cite and confirm details from accessible and authoritative sources.

Therefore, this report serves to clarify the inability to proceed with the requested article due to the unavailability of the provided source material, which is crucial for upholding the principles of factual and responsible journalism.
