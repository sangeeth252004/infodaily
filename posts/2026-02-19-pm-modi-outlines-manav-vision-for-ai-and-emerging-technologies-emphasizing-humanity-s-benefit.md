Prime Minister Narendra Modi has outlined his 'MANAV' vision, a comprehensive framework for the ethical and responsible development of emerging technologies, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) at its core. This vision, articulated in various public addresses, emphasizes that advancements such as Metaverse, AI, New Economy, Advanced Technology, and Virtual Reality (MANAV) should primarily serve humanity. The term 'MANAV' itself means 'human' in Hindi, underscoring the human-centric approach central to India's technological strategy.

The 'MANAV' vision advocates for a paradigm where technological innovation is directed towards societal well-being, fostering trust, and ensuring equitable access. Prime Minister Modi has consistently highlighted the critical need for global collaboration to establish common standards and frameworks for the responsible deployment of AI and other cutting-edge technologies. This approach aims to prevent potential misuse and mitigate risks while harnessing the transformative power of these innovations for positive global impact.

Key tenets of Prime Minister Modi's 'MANAV' vision include:
*   **Human-Centric Development:** A commitment to developing and deploying AI and related technologies that prioritize human welfare, rights, and ethical considerations above all else.
*   **Ethical Frameworks:** The establishment of transparent, fair, and accountable governance structures to address concerns such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and security.
*   **Inclusivity and Accessibility:** Ensuring that the benefits of technological progress are accessible to all sections of society, bridging digital divides, and empowering marginalized communities.
*   **Global Collaboration:** A call for international cooperation among nations to share best practices, develop common ethical guidelines, and jointly address the challenges posed by rapidly evolving technologies.
*   **Responsible Innovation:** Encouraging the creation of AI solutions that are "Made in India" but "Made for the world," signifying a dedication to developing solutions with global relevance and impact.

The vision positions AI not merely as a technological advancement but as a tool for "global good," capable of addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges. Prime Minister Modi has cited examples such as using AI in healthcare for disease detection and drug discovery, in agriculture for optimizing crop yields, and in governance for improving public service delivery. He has stressed that India's vast and diverse population provides a unique testing ground for developing robust and inclusive AI solutions.

Looking ahead, India is expected to continue advocating for a balanced approach to technological development on international platforms. This includes active participation in discussions surrounding AI governance, data ethics, and the future of digital economies. The 'MANAV' vision is anticipated to guide India's domestic policy formulation regarding AI research, development, and deployment, reinforcing the nation's commitment to fostering a responsible and beneficial technological ecosystem for its citizens and the wider global community.
