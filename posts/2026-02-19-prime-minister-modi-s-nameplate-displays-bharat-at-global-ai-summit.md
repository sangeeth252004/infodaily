Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nameplate at a recent global artificial intelligence (AI) summit in New Delhi notably featured "Bharat" as the nation’s identifier, deviating from the more commonly used "India." This instance marks a continued pattern of employing the ancient Sanskrit name in high-profile international forums, drawing attention to a broader national discussion regarding the country's nomenclature.

The display of "Bharat" on the Prime Minister's nameplate follows heightened public and political discourse surrounding the nation's official identity, particularly amplified during the G20 Summit hosted in New Delhi in September 2023. During that event, official invitations for a state dinner from President Droupadi Murmu referred to her as the "President of Bharat," and "Bharat" was visibly used on nameplates and official documents throughout the proceedings. This consistent application at significant international gatherings signals an ongoing intent to integrate "Bharat" more prominently into the global lexicon.

Constitutionally, India’s foundational document currently uses both names interchangeably, stating, "India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States." The name "Bharat" is deeply rooted in the nation's cultural and historical heritage, derived from ancient Sanskrit texts and widely used across various Indian languages. Proponents of using "Bharat" exclusively argue it resonates more profoundly with India's indigenous identity and helps to shed names associated with colonial-era nomenclature. Conversely, some commentators have raised concerns about the potential administrative and international implications of a widespread or exclusive shift, including the established global recognition of "India" and the bureaucratic adjustments it might necessitate.

At the specific AI summit, which convened leaders, policymakers, and experts to discuss the future of artificial intelligence, its ethical development, and global cooperation, PM Modi's nameplate was clearly visible with "Bharat" displayed in English script. The summit's agenda focused on critical discussions ranging from AI safety and responsible deployment to leveraging AI for economic growth and social good. The prominent use of "Bharat" at such an internationally attended event reinforces the government's approach to national branding on the global stage.

While the Prime Minister’s Office has not issued a specific statement detailing the decision behind the nameplate at this particular summit, the action aligns with previous visible instances of promoting "Bharat" in official capacities. This trend suggests a strategic and deliberate effort to elevate the historical name in both domestic and international contexts. The ongoing adoption of "Bharat" in diplomatic and high-level settings is anticipated to continue shaping national identity discussions and influencing international perceptions of the country's chosen nomenclature.
