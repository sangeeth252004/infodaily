The Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) has released the provisional answer key for the School Teacher Competitive Examination TRE-3 (Phase 3), widely referred to as TRE 3.0, conducted in March 2024. This release provides candidates who appeared for the examination with an opportunity to review their responses against the official key and raise objections if discrepancies are identified. The provisional key became available on March 16, 2024, on the official BPSC websites.

The TRE 3.0 examination was held on March 15, 2024, across various centers in Bihar. This recruitment drive aims to fill teaching positions for different classes, including Class 1-5, Class 6-8, Class 9-10, and Class 11-12. The publication of the provisional answer key is a standard procedure following major competitive examinations, allowing for transparency and ensuring a fair evaluation process before final results are compiled.

Candidates are advised to carefully check the provisional answer key for their respective subjects and question paper series. Should any candidate believe an answer provided in the provisional key is incorrect, they are permitted to challenge it by submitting an online objection.

Key details regarding the objection process are as follows:
*   **Objection Window:** The online objection submission period commenced on March 17, 2024, and will conclude on March 20, 2024.
*   **Submission Platform:** Objections must be submitted exclusively through the official BPSC online portal at onlinebpsc.bihar.gov.in.
*   **Procedure:** Candidates are required to log in to their accounts using their credentials.
*   **Evidence Requirement:** All objections must be supported by valid proof or evidence. Candidates must upload scanned copies of relevant documents to substantiate their claims. Objections submitted without proper evidence will not be considered.
*   **Submission Method:** No objections will be accepted via post, email, or any other manual method; only online submissions through the designated portal will be processed.

Candidates can access the provisional answer key and subsequent objection submission portal by following these steps:
*   Visit the official BPSC website: bpsc.bih.nic.in or onlinebpsc.bihar.gov.in.
*   Locate the link pertaining to the "Provisional Answer Key for School Teacher Competitive Examination TRE-3 (Phase 3) 2024."
*   Download the PDF file for the relevant subject and series.
*   For submitting objections, navigate to onlinebpsc.bihar.gov.in, log in, and follow the instructions to upload evidence against specific questions.

Upon the closure of the objection window, the BPSC will review all submitted challenges. A panel of subject matter experts will evaluate the objections and the supporting evidence. Following this review, a final answer key will be published, incorporating any necessary corrections. The final answer key will form the basis for the evaluation of candidate performance and the eventual declaration of results for the TRE 3.0 examination. This process is integral to the timely completion of teacher recruitment in Bihar.
