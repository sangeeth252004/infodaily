Indian benchmark indices commenced trading with marginal movements on Friday, February 20, 2026, as the Nifty50 opened largely flat and the BSE Sensex hovered near the 82,500 mark. On Dalal Street, investor sentiment appeared cautious, influenced by a blend of domestic factors and prevailing geopolitical developments across global markets.

The S&P BSE Sensex initiated the day's session at 82,485.10 points, reflecting a modest gain of approximately 45 points from its previous close. Simultaneously, the NSE Nifty50 began trading at 23,870.25 points, showing a minor adjustment of around 15 points, indicative of a flat opening. This subdued start followed a period of mixed global cues, with international developments dictating some of the early market direction.

Market analysts noted that trading activity was primarily driven by sector-specific movements and profit-booking in certain counters. While some heavyweight stocks showed resilience, broader market participation reflected a wait-and-watch approach as investors assessed the evolving international landscape. The stability observed in the early hours suggested that while positive domestic triggers were present, they were largely counterbalanced by external uncertainties.

Key influencing factors included:
*   **Global Market Performance:** Overnight trading in major US markets saw mixed closings, with technology stocks showing some volatility. Asian markets, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's KOSPI, displayed varied trends in early trade, contributing to the cautious mood in Mumbai.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Heightened geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran remained a significant concern for global investors. Reports indicating increased rhetoric and naval activity near the Strait of Hormuz contributed to uncertainty.
*   **Oil Prices:** Crude oil prices registered minor fluctuations in international markets. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for global oil shipments, is often sensitive to geopolitical tensions, impacting crude benchmarks like Brent and WTI. Any disruption or perceived threat in this region typically leads to an upward pressure on oil prices, which can have implications for energy-importing nations such as India.

Market participants are expected to continue monitoring geopolitical developments, particularly those concerning the US-Iran situation and its potential impact on global energy markets. Domestic economic data and corporate earnings reports, as they emerge, will also provide further direction for Indian equities in the sessions ahead.
