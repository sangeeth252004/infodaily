NEW DELHI – The Indian Supreme Court on Tuesday, October 24, delivered a significant ruling on a contentious trade dispute, largely upholding the government's imposition of safeguard duties on certain imported goods. The verdict, stemming from a challenge to policies initiated during a period of heightened global trade protectionism, included a notable dissenting opinion that underscored India's sovereign decision-making in both trade and energy procurement, specifically referencing the nation's continued imports of Russian crude oil.

The case, *Federation of Indian Manufacturers vs. Union of India*, centered on the legality and economic justification of elevated safeguard duties applied to specific specialty steel imports. These duties were initially implemented by the government in 2018-2019, aligning with a global trend of protectionist measures. This period often saw countries re-evaluate trade policies in response to the 'America First' trade agenda of the then-US Trump administration, which influenced broader international trade dynamics and encouraged similar domestic industry protections worldwide. The majority three-judge bench affirmed the government's authority to levy such duties, citing the imperative to protect nascent domestic industries from predatory pricing and unfair competition. The court’s majority opinion emphasized the executive branch's prerogative in formulating economic policy for national interest.

However, in a separate dissenting judgment, one of the judges introduced a wider perspective on India's strategic autonomy in economic affairs. The dissent argued that just as a nation asserts its right to implement trade barriers based on domestic economic imperatives, it similarly exercises its sovereign right in securing vital resources on the global stage, even when faced with international pressures. The dissenting opinion implicitly drew a connection between the principles of trade protectionism for domestic industry and the safeguarding of national energy security.

Key points highlighted in the dissenting opinion included:
*   **Economic Sovereignty**: The dissent posited that India’s economic policies, whether related to trade tariffs or energy procurement, are fundamentally rooted in securing the nation’s economic stability and fostering growth.
*   **Resource Security**: A direct comparison was made to India's strategic decision to continue purchasing discounted crude oil from Russia following the conflict in Ukraine. The dissent noted that these oil imports were critical for managing domestic inflation, ensuring energy security for its population of over 1.4 billion, and maintaining economic momentum.
*   **National Interest**: The dissenting judge explicitly stated that the principle of national interest guides both the imposition of protective tariffs to safeguard domestic industries and the diversification of energy sources to mitigate economic shocks. This perspective suggested a consistent framework for independent foreign and economic policy.

India significantly increased its imports of Russian crude oil after February 2022, capitalizing on discounted prices. Data from commodity analytics firms indicates that Russia became India's largest oil supplier in 2023, accounting for over 35% of its total crude imports, a substantial increase from less than 2% prior to the conflict. This shift has been a cornerstone of India's energy strategy amid global energy market volatility and geopolitical shifts.

The Supreme Court's verdict on safeguard duties, particularly the dissenting judge's commentary, offers a judicial perspective on India's evolving approach to international trade and foreign policy. It reinforces the narrative of India prioritizing its national interests in a multipolar world, balancing global economic engagements with strategic autonomy. While the majority ruling settles the immediate legal challenge regarding steel tariffs, the dissent offers a broader commentary on the principles guiding India's economic resilience and independent foreign policy decisions, linking seemingly disparate areas of national governance under a common theme of sovereignty. The ruling is expected to inform future discussions on India's trade posture and its justifications for navigating complex international geopolitical landscapes.
