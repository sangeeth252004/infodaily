Quentin Griffiths, a co-founder of the prominent British online fashion and beauty retailer Asos, has reportedly died in Thailand after falling from a 17th-floor balcony. The passing was confirmed through an official company announcement, prompting an investigation by local authorities into the circumstances surrounding the incident.

The news of Mr. Griffiths's death emerged recently, marking a somber moment for the e-commerce sector and the fashion industry. While the company confirmed his death, specific details regarding the exact date and location within Thailand, beyond the reference to a 17th-floor fall, were not immediately released in the initial public statements. The term "mysterious death" in initial reports highlights the ongoing nature of the inquiry into the incident.

Mr. Griffiths was instrumental in the establishment of Asos plc in 2000, alongside Nick Robertson. The company, initially named "As Seen On Screen," aimed to sell clothes similar to those seen on celebrities. Over two decades, it grew from a nascent idea into a global fashion powerhouse, becoming one of the United Kingdom's largest online retailers specializing in fashion and cosmetics. His strategic input and vision during the company's formative years were critical to its eventual success and market positioning.

The impact of Mr. Griffiths's death extends beyond his immediate family and personal circle, resonating within the business and e-commerce communities. Asos has grown to serve millions of customers worldwide, offering thousands of products from various brands, including its own labels. The contributions of its founders, like Mr. Griffiths, laid the groundwork for this expansive reach and influence in the digital retail landscape.

*   **Circumstance:** Died after falling from a 17th-floor balcony.

Thai authorities are expected to lead a thorough investigation into the events leading to Mr. Griffiths's death. Further information will likely be released as the investigation progresses.
