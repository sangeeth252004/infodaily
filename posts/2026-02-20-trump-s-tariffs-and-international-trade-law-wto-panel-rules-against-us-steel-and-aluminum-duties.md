A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute panel ruled on October 28, 2022, that certain tariffs imposed by the United States on steel and aluminum imports during the Trump administration violated international trade rules. The panel found that these Section 232 tariffs, enacted in 2018, could not be justified under the national security exceptions claimed by the United States. This ruling specifically addresses the trade measures from an international law perspective, distinct from domestic U.S. legal proceedings.

The WTO panel's decision concludes a dispute initiated by several member states, including China, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey. The panel determined that the additional duties of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports were inconsistent with various provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994, particularly Articles I:1 and II:1, which govern most-favored-nation treatment and tariff schedules. The panel further concluded that the United States had not adequately demonstrated that these measures were taken "in time of war or other emergency in international relations," as required to invoke the national security exception under GATT Article XXI.

The Section 232 tariffs were originally implemented in March 2018 under the administration of then-President Donald Trump, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This act allows the President to impose tariffs if the Commerce Department finds that imports threaten national security. The tariffs applied broadly to steel and aluminum products from numerous countries, though some exclusions and quotas were later negotiated with specific allies.

Domestically, challenges to the Section 232 tariffs have also proceeded through the U.S. legal system. While no "US top court" (implying the Supreme Court) has issued a broad ruling striking down these tariffs as illegal across the globe, the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have heard cases challenging specific aspects or applications of the tariffs. These domestic cases often focused on the scope of presidential authority under Section 232 and procedural compliance, rather than directly on the international legality of the tariffs. For instance, some rulings have affirmed the President's discretion in making national security determinations, while others have addressed specific exclusions or administrative processes.

Key details of the WTO ruling and the tariffs include:
*   **Tariff Imposition:** March 2018, by President Donald Trump.
*   **Tariff Rates:** 25% on steel imports, 10% on aluminum imports.
*   **Legal Basis (US):** Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, citing national security.
*   **WTO Ruling Date:** October 28, 2022.
*   **WTO Finding:** Tariffs violated GATT 1994 Articles I:1 and II:1.
*   **National Security Exception:** WTO panel found the US did not meet the criteria for GATT Article XXI.
*   **Complainant Countries:** China, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey.

Following the WTO panel's recommendation, the United States is expected to bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under the GATT. However, the U.S. government has historically expressed reservations regarding WTO dispute panel findings that challenge its national security justifications, and has signaled that it does not intend to remove the tariffs based on this ruling. The U.S. position often contends that national security is a sovereign matter not subject to review by WTO panels. This stance, coupled with the U.S.'s ongoing blockage of appointments to the WTO's Appellate Body, means the path forward for resolving such trade disputes remains uncertain. The ruling highlights the ongoing tension between national security interests and international trade obligations.
