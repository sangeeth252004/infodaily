Texas Senator John Cornyn drew significant public attention and criticism in September 2022 following a social media post that declared "Welcome to the Indian Century." The statement was published on the senator's official X (formerly Twitter) account after he concluded a visit to India, during which he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government officials to discuss bilateral relations. The post generated considerable debate online, with some commentators referencing the phrase "'Why Dallas looks like New Delhi'" in their reactions to Cornyn's message.

Senator Cornyn's visit to India aimed to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties between the United States and India. As a prominent Republican senator, his engagements included discussions on strategic partnerships, trade, and defense cooperation. The "Welcome to the Indian Century" message was posted in this context, signaling a recognition of India's growing global influence.

The public reaction to the social media post was immediate and varied. Critics on platforms such as X interpreted the senator's phrasing in multiple ways, with some expressing concerns about its implications for domestic policy, particularly regarding immigration and demographic shifts within Texas and other U.S. states. The phrase "Why Dallas looks like New Delhi" emerged within these discussions as a representation of some critics' views on population changes and cultural diversity.

*   **Context of the visit:** Senator Cornyn's trip to India involved high-level meetings focused on enhancing the U.S.-India strategic partnership.
*   **Social media platform:** The contentious post was made on X (formerly Twitter).
*   **Nature of criticism:** Reactions included accusations of xenophobia and insensitivity from some individuals, while others defended the senator's statement as acknowledging India's rising geopolitical and economic power.

The backlash highlighted ongoing national conversations about immigration, cultural identity, and the portrayal of international relations by political figures. Some commentators argued that the senator's choice of words, especially when combined with the phrase "Indian Century," could be misconstrued or used to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment. Conversely, supporters suggested the post merely recognized India's economic growth and its increasing importance on the global stage.

As of the immediate aftermath of the post, Senator Cornyn's office did not issue an official clarification or retraction regarding the language used in the tweet. The incident underscored the intensified scrutiny political statements face in the digital age and the complex challenges of communicating nuanced diplomatic messages to a broad public audience. While the social media debate primarily focused on domestic political discourse and interpretation, it did not lead to any immediate diplomatic repercussions concerning U.S.-India relations. The event served as a notable instance of how public figures' communications can resonate and be interpreted differently across various segments of society.
