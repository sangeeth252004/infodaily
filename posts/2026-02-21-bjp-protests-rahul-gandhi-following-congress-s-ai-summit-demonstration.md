Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demonstrated with black flags against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on October 26, 2023. The protest occurred following earlier "shirtless protests" by Congress activists at a prominent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit. The BJP stated its actions were a condemnation of the nature of the Congress party's earlier demonstration, which they described as inappropriate for a technology conference.

The BJP's protest took place as Mr. Gandhi's convoy passed through a key route near the summit venue in New Delhi. Numerous BJP members gathered, holding black flags and chanting slogans critical of the Congress party and its leadership. Party spokespersons indicated that the demonstration aimed to highlight what they perceived as a lack of decorum and seriousness from the Congress party regarding significant national and technological discussions, specifically referencing the "shirtless protests" that had drawn public attention.

Earlier that week, Congress party activists staged a unique protest at the ongoing AI Summit. During their demonstration, several participants removed their shirts, bearing slogans written on their torsos, to highlight specific concerns regarding the government's approach to technology and AI policy. The Congress party stated its protest was aimed at drawing urgent attention to issues such as data privacy, the potential for job displacement due to automation, and what they termed a lack of inclusive policymaking in the rapidly evolving AI sector. The demonstration sought to symbolize a 'bare-chested' plea for transparency and accountability from the government regarding future technological advancements and their societal impact.

*   **BJP's Condemnation:** The BJP criticized the Congress's protest method, calling it "undignified" and "distracting" from serious policy discussions.
*   **Congress's Justification:** Congress leaders defended their activists' actions as a "symbolic and powerful" way to express deep-seated public grievances on critical technology issues.
*   **Location:** Both incidents occurred in proximity to or within the vicinity of the high-profile AI Summit held in New Delhi, which brought together policymakers, industry leaders, and tech experts.

This sequence of events underscores the heightened political friction between India's two largest parties. The BJP's swift counter-protest against Mr. Gandhi suggests a strategy to immediately challenge and criticize opposition tactics deemed controversial. Conversely, the Congress party's decision to employ an unconventional protest method at a technology summit reflects an effort to cut through traditional political discourse and amplify their message on AI-related concerns. Both parties' actions are expected to fuel further debate on appropriate forms of political dissent and the nature of engagement on crucial policy platforms. Further statements from political leaders on both sides are anticipated as the broader political discourse continues.
