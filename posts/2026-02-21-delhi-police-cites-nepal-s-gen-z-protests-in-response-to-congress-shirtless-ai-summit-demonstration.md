New Delhi, India – Delhi Police officials have issued a statement linking a recent shirtless protest by members of the Congress party at the Global AI Conclave 2024 to protest tactics employed by Gen-Z activists in Nepal. The demonstration, which occurred on Friday, October 26, 2024, saw several Congress youth wing members march outside the summit venue, shedding their shirts to protest what they termed the government's inadequate policies regarding artificial intelligence and its potential impact on employment.

The police communiqué highlighted the visual and symbolic nature of the protest, drawing a direct parallel to youth-led movements observed in Nepal. A senior Delhi Police official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments, stated, "Our intelligence suggests a growing trend of protest methodologies being adopted across international borders. This particular demonstration by Congress members, with its emphasis on visual messaging and a distinctive, attention-grabbing act, appears to draw parallels with recent youth-led movements in Nepal, known for their innovative and often shirtless or semi-clad forms of protest to highlight various grievances."

The Congress protest focused on several key concerns surrounding AI adoption in India. Demonstrators alleged that the current administration has failed to adequately address the potential for widespread job displacement due to automation and artificial intelligence, as well as neglecting the ethical frameworks necessary for responsible AI development. The shirtless display was reportedly intended to symbolize the "stripping away" of opportunities and the vulnerability of the workforce.

*   **Protest Date:** Friday, October 26, 2024
*   **Location:** Outside the Global AI Conclave 2024 venue, New Delhi
*   **Participants:** Members of the Congress party's youth wing
*   **Method:** Shirtless march, intended as symbolic protest
*   **Allegations:** Government's inadequate AI policy, potential job displacement, lack of ethical guidelines
*   **Police Observation:** Noted similarity to Nepal's Gen-Z protest tactics, which often feature unique visual acts

The reference to Nepal's Gen-Z protests by Delhi Police comes as youth-led activism globally has increasingly leveraged social media and unconventional methods to garner attention and press for change. In Nepal, young activists have utilized highly visible and sometimes provocative acts, including shirtless demonstrations, to draw focus to issues such as governance, corruption, and economic hardship, often finding significant traction online and in local media.

This development underscores the evolving landscape of political protest in India, where traditional forms of dissent are being augmented by tactics observed in other nations, often amplified through digital platforms. The Delhi Police's explicit mention of cross-border inspiration suggests a monitoring of international protest trends and their potential influence on domestic demonstrations. Observers indicate that authorities may be assessing the implications of such symbolic protests for public order management and the broader political discourse surrounding technological advancements. The Congress party has not yet officially responded to the Delhi Police's specific commentary regarding the inspiration for their protest method. The Global AI Conclave 2024 concluded without further major disruptions, though discussions around AI policy are expected to continue in the political arena.
