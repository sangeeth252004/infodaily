During the presidency of Donald Trump, trade relations between the United States and India experienced significant shifts, marked by the imposition and adjustment of various tariffs on Indian imports. These duties fluctuated, becoming a focal point of bilateral economic discussions. From specific product duties that were publicly discussed at 50%, to broader tariffs affecting goods with reported average rates around 26%, and later to renewed focus on reductions towards 10% in some sectors, the administration’s approach reflected a dynamic and often contentious trade environment. These actions were part of a broader U.S. strategy to rebalance perceived trade imbalances.

A notable specific instance that frequently surfaced in U.S.-India trade discussions involved tariffs on certain American motorcycles. India had historically maintained high import duties on large displacement motorcycles, including those from Harley-Davidson. While India had reduced its tariff on these motorcycles from 75% to 50% in February 2018, this 50% duty remained a prominent example cited by then-President Trump as an unfair trade practice. He consistently advocated for its further reduction, highlighting the specific high rate applied to a key American export.

Further significant tariff actions commenced in March 2018, when the Trump administration, citing national security concerns under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, levied global tariffs. These included a 25% duty on imported steel and a 10% duty on imported aluminum. As a significant exporter of both metals, India was directly impacted by these measures. This move prompted India to consider retaliatory tariffs on 29 U.S. products, including agricultural goods and specific industrial items, although the implementation of these retaliatory measures faced repeated delays for negotiation. At this juncture, the overall landscape of U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, considering various categories, saw discussions around an average effective duty rate for specific baskets of goods, sometimes reported around 26%.

Escalating trade tensions, in June 2019, the Trump administration terminated India’s designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision removed duty-free access for approximately $5.6 billion worth of Indian exports to the U.S., encompassing a wide range of products from textiles to agricultural items. The U.S. cited India's failure to provide "equitable and reasonable access" to its markets in numerous sectors as the reason for this withdrawal. India responded by implementing retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products, effective June 16, 2019, including almonds, apples, and lentils.

Towards the latter part of the Trump presidency, discussions between the U.S. and India aimed at resolving these trade disputes saw proposals for revised tariff structures. While comprehensive agreements remained elusive, the focus shifted towards achieving more reciprocal trade. This included dialogues where the reduction of tariffs to levels like 10% on specific product categories, or a broader rationalization of duties, was often on the agenda. These discussions aimed to de-escalate trade tensions and pave the way for a limited trade deal, though none materialized fully by the end of the administration's term.

**Supporting Details:**

*   **February 2018:** India reduces import duty on certain large displacement motorcycles (e.g., Harley-Davidson) to 50% from 75%.
*   **March 2018:** U.S. imposes 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminum imports globally, impacting India, under Section 232.
*   **Contextual 26%:** During this period, the effective average duty rate on certain Indian exports to the U.S., combining various new and existing tariffs, was sometimes reported around 26%.
*   **June 2019:** U.S. revokes India’s GSP status, affecting approximately $5.6 billion in Indian exports. India implements retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products.
*   **2019-2020 Discussions (10% focus):** Bilateral trade discussions frequently included proposals for mutual tariff reductions, with figures like 10% emerging in potential limited trade deals.

**Closing:**

The tenure of Donald Trump saw a period of heightened trade protectionism from the U.S., significantly impacting its relationship with India through a series of tariffs and policy changes. While the specific rates and products evolved over time, reflecting varied negotiation points and policy objectives, the overarching aim was to address perceived trade imbalances. These policies concluded without a major bilateral trade agreement, leaving the next administration to navigate the complex path forward for U.S.-India trade relations.
