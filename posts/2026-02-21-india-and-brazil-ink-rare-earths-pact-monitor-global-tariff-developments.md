India and Brazil have formalized an agreement for the supply and exploration of rare earth elements and other critical minerals. The pact, signed in late 2022, represents a strategic move by both nations to diversify their access to these essential materials and reduce heavy reliance on existing dominant suppliers in the global market.

The collaboration focuses on enhancing resource security for a range of modern technologies. Rare earth elements are crucial components in various high-tech applications, including electric vehicles, smartphones, defense systems, and renewable energy technologies. The global market for these minerals has largely been dominated by a single nation, with estimates indicating control over 70-80% of worldwide processing and production.

Key details of the India-Brazil rare earths pact include:
*   **Joint Exploration:** Initiatives for geological surveying, exploration, and identification of new mineral deposits.
*   **Technological Exchange:** Sharing of expertise and technology in mining and processing critical minerals.
*   **Capacity Building:** Collaboration on developing infrastructure and human resources for the rare earths sector.
*   **Strategic Objective:** To establish a more resilient and geographically diverse supply chain for essential rare earth elements.

Brazil possesses significant rare earth reserves, holding approximately 21% of the world's known deposits. India, while having a smaller share of global reserves at 1.2%, aims to enhance its capabilities in mid-stream processing of these elements. The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) is the nodal agency for India in this endeavor, working alongside Brazil's Geological Survey (CPRM).

Concurrently with this new partnership, India has indicated it will adopt a "wait and watch" approach regarding the potential fallout from a pending U.S. Supreme Court tariff order concerning rare earths. In 2019, the United States imposed 25% tariffs on rare earth imports from China, a decision that faced legal challenges. The outcome of the Supreme Court's review could significantly influence global rare earth pricing and market dynamics, potentially impacting the economic viability and strategic planning of new rare earth ventures worldwide, including those emerging from the India-Brazil pact.

The long-term success of this bilateral rare earths collaboration will hinge on the effective implementation of joint projects, the successful transfer of technology, and the evolving geopolitical landscape surrounding critical mineral supply chains. Both India and Brazil are positioning themselves to bolster their strategic independence and contribute to a more diversified global supply network for the foundational components of future technologies.
