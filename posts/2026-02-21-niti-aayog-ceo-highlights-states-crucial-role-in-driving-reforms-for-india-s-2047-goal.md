New Delhi – The then Chief Executive Officer of Niti Aayog, Parameswaran Iyer, underscored the critical importance of Indian states in driving the next wave of economic and governance reforms necessary for the nation to achieve its ambitious goal of becoming a developed economy by 2047. Addressing a policy discussion in August 2022, Iyer emphasized that while significant progress has been made through central initiatives, the onus for future transformative change largely rests with individual states.

The statement by the Niti Aayog CEO highlights a strategic shift towards empowering states as primary architects of development. India's Vision 2047, coinciding with the centenary of its independence, aims for comprehensive socio-economic advancement, marked by sustainable growth, improved living standards, and robust infrastructure. Achieving this objective, according to Niti Aayog, will require decentralized policy implementation and reforms tailored to specific regional contexts and needs. States are seen as key implementers due to their direct jurisdiction over crucial sectors that impact grassroots development and citizen welfare.

Iyer’s remarks focused on the concept of 'cooperative and competitive federalism,' a guiding principle of Niti Aayog since its inception in 2015. This framework encourages states to collaborate with the central government on national priorities while also competing healthily amongst themselves in terms of governance, ease of doing business, and socio-economic indicators. The next phase of reforms is expected to build upon this foundation, allowing states greater autonomy and responsibility in policy design and execution.

Key areas identified for state-driven reforms include:
*   **Land Reforms:** Streamlining land acquisition processes, digitization of land records, and enabling efficient land utilization for infrastructure and industrial projects.
*   **Urban Governance:** Modernizing municipal administration, improving urban planning, and enhancing service delivery in rapidly growing cities.
*   **Labour Laws:** Adapting labour regulations to foster industrial growth, create employment opportunities, and enhance worker welfare, while attracting investment.
*   **Power Sector:** Reforming power distribution companies, reducing aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses, and promoting renewable energy adoption at the state level.
*   **Agriculture:** Implementing measures to boost farmer incomes, improve agricultural productivity, and enhance food processing capabilities.
*   **Health and Education:** Strengthening public health infrastructure, improving educational outcomes, and ensuring equitable access to quality services.

Niti Aayog, as the government’s premier think tank, is tasked with fostering this state-led reform agenda through capacity building, knowledge sharing, and facilitating best practices across states. It functions as a platform for states to share successes, learn from challenges, and receive expert guidance on policy formulation and implementation strategies. The emphasis on state ownership is designed to ensure that reforms are not merely centrally mandated but are genuinely embraced and adapted at the local level for maximum impact.

Looking ahead, the commitment from state governments to initiate and sustain these reforms will be crucial for realizing India's 2047 vision. Niti Aayog is expected to continue its role in monitoring progress, providing policy frameworks, and fostering an environment where states can innovate and lead in their respective domains. The success of this decentralized approach will ultimately determine the pace and inclusivity of India’s journey towards becoming a developed nation.
