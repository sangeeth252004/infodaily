A Chief Judicial Magistrate's court in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, has ordered the registration of a First Information Report (FIR) against Swami Avimukteshwaranand in connection with allegations of sexual exploitation, fraud, and criminal intimidation. The order, issued on December 16, 2022, directs the Daraganj police station to lodge the FIR and commence an investigation into the matter.

The court's directive follows a complaint filed by Swami Anand Swaroop, the national general secretary of Sanyasi Ganga Mahasabha, on December 3, 2022. The complaint details serious allegations against Swami Avimukteshwaranand, who is recognized as the successor to the Dwarka-Sharda and Jyotish Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati. The court reviewed the evidence presented by the complainant before issuing its order.

This development marks the initiation of a formal police investigation into the accusations. The registration of an FIR is the preliminary step in a criminal legal process in India, allowing law enforcement agencies to officially record a case and begin their inquiry.

Key details surrounding the case include:
*   **Complainant:** Swami Anand Swaroop, National General Secretary of Sanyasi Ganga Mahasabha.
*   **Accused:** Swami Avimukteshwaranand.
*   **Court:** Chief Judicial Magistrate's court, Prayagraj.
*   **Date of Order:** December 16, 2022.
*   **Police Station Directed:** Daraganj police station.
*   **Allegations:** Sexual exploitation, fraud, and criminal intimidation.
*   **Indian Penal Code Sections:** The court has ordered the FIR to be lodged under Sections 376 (rape), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

According to the complaint, the alleged victim is a sanyasin (female ascetic). The allegations specifically claim that Swami Avimukteshwaranand exploited her sexually. Furthermore, the complaint asserts that the accused defrauded the sanyasin by allegedly transferring property in her name and illicitly obtaining a substantial sum of money, amounting to approximately rupees two crores. The complaint also includes allegations of criminal intimidation, suggesting threats were made against the victim.

The court's decision underscores the legal system's mechanism for addressing serious allegations, regardless of the public stature of the individuals involved. The Daraganj police station is now mandated to register the FIR and proceed with a thorough investigation, which will involve gathering evidence, recording statements, and examining the veracity of the claims made in the complaint.

The legal process is expected to continue with the police investigation, which will determine if sufficient evidence exists to file a chargesheet in court. The outcome of the police inquiry and any subsequent judicial proceedings will follow the established legal framework.
