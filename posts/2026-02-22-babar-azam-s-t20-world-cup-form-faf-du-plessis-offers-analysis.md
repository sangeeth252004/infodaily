Former South African captain Faf du Plessis recently offered his perspective on the batting form of Pakistan skipper Babar Azam during the ongoing ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Speaking in a broadcast analysis session on June 15, 2024, du Plessis indicated that Babar Azam appeared "a little bit behind" in his current approach, contributing to the challenges Pakistan has faced in the tournament hosted in the West Indies and USA. His comments followed a period where Babar Azam's individual scores have drawn scrutiny amid Pakistan's inconsistent team performance in the group stage.

Du Plessis, known for his leadership and extensive experience in international cricket, highlighted specific areas where Babar Azam might be encountering difficulties. While the precise technical details of his assessment were comprehensive, the general tenor suggested a potential struggle with adapting to varying pitch conditions and maintaining the aggressive strike rate often required in T20 international cricket. Babar Azam, currently ranked among the top batsmen in ODIs and T20Is by the ICC, has historically been a prolific run-scorer. However, his recent outings in the tournament have seen him register scores that, while not always failures, have sometimes lacked the commanding acceleration expected from an opener and captain.

The South African veteran's observations arrive at a critical juncture for Pakistan, as the team navigates a competitive group stage. Du Plessis's analysis, typically grounded in technical and tactical understanding, suggests that Babar Azam's customary fluent stroke-play might be facing resistance. This could be attributed to several factors, including the inherent pressure of captaincy in a global tournament, the high stakes involved in crucial matches, and potentially subtle changes in technique or mindset under duress. His remarks provide an expert's viewpoint on a situation that has become a significant talking point among cricket pundits and fans alike.

Babar Azam's performance in the current T20 World Cup has seen a statistical dip compared to his career averages:
*   His strike rate in several innings has been observed to be lower than his career T20I average.
*   Scores have been built at a pace that has sometimes placed additional pressure on subsequent batsmen.
*   These figures represent a departure from his usual high-performing standards in T20 international cricket, where he maintains a career strike rate exceeding 129.

The insights from Faf du Plessis underscore the scrutiny on Babar Azam not only as a batsman but also as the leader of the Pakistani contingent. As the tournament progresses, Babar's ability to adjust and overcome these perceived challenges will be crucial for Pakistan's aspirations. The team's immediate focus remains on securing progression from the group stages, with upcoming fixtures demanding strong performances from all players, particularly their skipper. The cricketing world will be observing whether du Plessis's analysis prompts a visible change in Babar Azam's approach in the latter stages of the competition.
