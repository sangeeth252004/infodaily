The Haryana state government has issued a significant directive instructing all its departments, boards, and corporations to immediately discontinue conducting financial transactions with private sector banks. The new policy mandates that all government-related financial dealings, including salary disbursements, pension payments, and management of departmental funds, must exclusively be channeled through public sector banks and cooperative banks operating within the state.

This move, communicated by the state's Finance Department, aims to consolidate government financial operations within state-owned and cooperative banking frameworks. The directive emphasizes a shift in focus towards strengthening public sector financial institutions and ensuring enhanced oversight of state funds. Officials have indicated that the decision is part of a broader strategy to streamline financial management and align banking partnerships with public sector objectives.

The directive applies comprehensively to a wide array of financial activities. These include, but are not limited to:

*   **Opening new bank accounts:** All new accounts for departments, boards, and corporations must be opened with public sector or cooperative banks.
*   **Existing accounts:** Efforts are to be made to transition existing operational accounts from private banks to approved public or cooperative banks where feasible and compliant with existing contractual obligations.
*   **Funds management:** The handling of all government deposits, grants, and disbursement of funds related to various state schemes and projects.
*   **Employee salaries and pensions:** The processing of all government employee salaries, allowances, and pension payments.
*   **Procurement and payments:** All payments to vendors, contractors, and beneficiaries, as well as revenue collection, are to be routed through the designated banks.

The decision is expected to have notable implications for both the public and private banking sectors in Haryana. Private banks that previously held significant government accounts or managed large volumes of state-related transactions may experience a reduction in their government business portfolios and associated fee incomes. Conversely, public sector banks and cooperative banks are poised to see an increase in deposits, transaction volumes, and overall business from the state government, potentially boosting their liquidity and market share within Haryana.

While the government has not specified an immediate, complete cessation of all existing relationships with private banks if contracts are in force, the clear policy direction indicates a strong preference for public and cooperative sector engagement going forward. The implementation of this directive will be closely monitored by the Finance Department to ensure compliance across all state entities. The long-term effects on the state's financial ecosystem and the operational strategies of banks will be a subject of continued observation.
