The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) is preparing to commence the online registration process for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Master of Dental Surgery (NEET MDS) 2026. Aspiring dental postgraduates seeking admission to MDS courses across India will soon be able to apply through the official NBEMS website, natboard.edu.in. An official announcement detailing the precise schedule and information brochure is anticipated shortly, marking a crucial step for thousands of dental graduates.

NEET MDS serves as the single entrance examination for admission to all Master of Dental Surgery courses offered at various dental colleges and institutions nationwide, including All India 50% Quota Seats (except Jammu & Kashmir), State Quota Seats, private dental colleges, deemed universities, and Armed Forces Medical Services institutions. The examination is mandatory for candidates aiming to pursue advanced studies and specialization in dentistry.

The eligibility criteria for NEET MDS typically mandate candidates to possess a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree awarded by a university or institute in India recognized by the Dental Council of India (DCI). Furthermore, applicants must have completed a compulsory one-year rotating internship by a specified cut-off date, which will be outlined in the official information bulletin for the 2026 cycle. Provisional registration with the State Dental Council is also a standard requirement. Specific details regarding foreign medical graduates or candidates with degrees from outside India will also be provided in the comprehensive brochure.

This annual examination is critical for the dental healthcare sector, ensuring a standardized assessment for entry into postgraduate dental programs. The NBEMS, responsible for conducting various postgraduate medical and dental entrance examinations, maintains a rigorous process to select eligible candidates based on merit. The upcoming registration period provides candidates with the first official window to initiate their application journey for the 2026 academic session.

Key details regarding the NEET MDS 2026 application process will include:
*   **Application Commencement:** The exact start date for online applications will be announced on natboard.edu.in.
*   **Application Deadline:** A specific closing date for registrations will be notified, after which the application portal will cease to accept new submissions.
