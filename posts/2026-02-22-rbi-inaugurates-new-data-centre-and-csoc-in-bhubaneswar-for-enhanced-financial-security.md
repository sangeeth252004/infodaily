The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officially inaugurated a new data centre and a Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, on August 26, 2022. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das presided over the event, marking a strategic enhancement of the nation's financial infrastructure. This facility is designed to bolster the resilience and security of India's critical financial systems, specifically mitigating risks from seismic activity and sophisticated cross-border cyber threats.

The establishment of this new data centre and CSOC is a critical component of the RBI's ongoing efforts to safeguard the stability and integrity of the country's financial landscape. The location in Bhubaneswar was chosen following comprehensive assessments to ensure geographical diversification and minimize exposure to potential natural disasters, particularly seismic events, thereby enhancing business continuity capabilities. The facility is equipped to host vital financial data and support the operational backbone of various payment and settlement systems, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery even under adverse conditions.

The integration of the Cyber Security Operations Centre alongside the data centre underscores the RBI's proactive stance against the growing complexities of cyber warfare. The CSOC is tasked with round-the-clock monitoring of potential cyber threats, rapid incident detection, and robust response mechanisms to protect sensitive financial data and prevent breaches across the Indian banking and financial sector. This strategic installation provides a centralized hub for managing and analyzing cyber intelligence, allowing for swift action against emerging threats that could impact national financial stability.

Key aspects and benefits of the new facility include:
*   **Enhanced Resilience:** The location provides geographical diversification from existing RBI facilities, reducing systemic risk from localized events such as natural disasters.
*   **Robust Data Security:** Designed with advanced physical and digital security protocols to protect sensitive financial information and critical operational data.
*   **Business Continuity:** Ensures uninterrupted functioning of essential financial services, including payment systems, vital for the economy.
*   **Cyber Threat Mitigation:** The co-located CSOC offers real-time threat detection, analysis, and response capabilities against evolving cyberattacks originating from domestic and international sources.
*   **Support for Digital India:** Reinforces the infrastructure necessary to support the increasing digitization of financial services and transactions across the country.

The inauguration ceremony saw attendance from various RBI officials, state government representatives, and stakeholders from the financial technology sector, highlighting the collaborative effort required to fortify India's digital financial ecosystem. Governor Das emphasized the pivotal role of robust and secure digital infrastructure in fostering economic growth and maintaining public trust in the financial system.

Looking ahead, the operationalization of the Bhubaneswar data centre and CSOC is expected to significantly strengthen the RBI's capacity to manage and protect India's financial data. It represents a long-term investment in national financial security, positioning the country to better withstand evolving threats and ensure the continuous, secure operation of its financial services in an increasingly digitized world. The facility will play a central role in the RBI's broader strategy to enhance its technological capabilities and maintain a high standard of operational readiness for the entire financial sector.
