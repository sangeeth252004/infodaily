State Bank of India (SBI), India's largest public sector lender, has outlined a strategic objective to increase the share of its green advances to up to 10% of its total loan book by the year 2030. Concurrently, the bank announced the establishment of a specialized Centre for Sunrise Sectors, designed to facilitate financing for emerging industries crucial to India's economic and environmental transition. These initiatives were detailed by SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara in October 2022.

This strategic move underscores SBI's commitment to supporting India's national sustainability objectives, including its net-zero emissions target by 2070. Green advances encompass a range of financial products and services directed towards projects and businesses that contribute to environmental sustainability. This includes investments in renewable energy generation, energy efficiency improvements, waste management solutions, green building construction, and the adoption of electric mobility. By targeting a 10% allocation, SBI aims to significantly channel capital towards climate-friendly investments across various sectors.

The newly established Centre for Sunrise Sectors is designed to serve as a focused hub, offering specialized financing and expertise to industries identified for their high growth potential and strategic importance in shaping India's future economy. These emerging sectors often require tailored financial solutions due to their innovative business models and rapidly evolving technological landscapes. SBI Chairman Khara indicated that the bank has identified 10 to 12 such sectors for focused attention and support.

Key sectors identified for support through the new centre include:
*   Electric Vehicles (EVs) and associated infrastructure
*   Renewable Energy, encompassing solar, wind, and hydro power projects
*   Green Hydrogen production and related infrastructure development
*   Battery Storage solutions for grid stability and energy independence
*   Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies
*   Space-tech innovations and their commercial applications
*   Circular Economy initiatives, promoting resource efficiency and waste reduction

This dedicated approach is expected to provide companies within these emerging fields with enhanced access to capital, fostering innovation and facilitating the scaling up of critical infrastructure. As India progresses towards its economic and environmental targets, the growth of these sunrise sectors is considered vital for creating new employment opportunities, enhancing national energy security, and reducing the nation's overall carbon footprint.

SBI's strategy to expand green financing and specifically support sunrise sectors is anticipated to have broader implications for the Indian banking sector. As a market leader, SBI's initiatives often set benchmarks for other financial institutions, potentially encouraging wider adoption of similar sustainable lending practices. This development aligns with global trends where financial institutions increasingly integrate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into their core lending and investment strategies. The bank's commitment to these areas is expected to play a significant role in facilitating India's transition to a greener and more sustainable economy by providing crucial financial backing for the industries poised to drive this transformation. The implementation of these plans will involve developing specific products, establishing appraisal mechanisms tailored for these unique sectors, and building internal expertise within the bank.
