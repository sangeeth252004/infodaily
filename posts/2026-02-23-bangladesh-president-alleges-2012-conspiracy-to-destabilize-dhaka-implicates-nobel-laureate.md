Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid recently alleged a conspiracy in 2012 to remove him from office and destabilize the nation's capital, Dhaka. Speaking during a special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) on Sunday, President Hamid specifically implicated Nobel Peace Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus in the purported plot, citing "secret trips" and "secret meetings" with foreign diplomats.

President Hamid, whose presidential term is set to conclude in April 2023, stated he felt compelled to disclose these details before his retirement. He recounted that in 2012, while serving as Speaker of Parliament, he received information from an intelligence agency detailing a conspiracy aimed at his removal. The President asserted that Dr. Yunus engaged in multiple undisclosed international trips and held confidential discussions with foreign envoys to advance the alleged agenda.

*   **Specific Allegations:**
    *   President Hamid claimed Dr. Yunus met with a foreign minister from a "prominent country" in a "very confidential manner" at a hotel in Dhaka.
    *   The purpose of this meeting, according to Hamid, was to discuss Bangladesh's political landscape and the potential for destabilization.
    *   Hamid stated he faced "huge pressure" from both "internal and external" sources to resign from his position, but he refused.

The President maintained that his refusal to yield to pressure ultimately thwarted the alleged conspiracy. He emphasized that the plot was not only directed at his position but also intended to create political instability within the country.

Dr. Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microcredit. However, his relationship with the ruling Awami League government has been strained for several years. In 2011, Bangladesh's central bank removed Yunus from his position as managing director of Grameen Bank, citing age limit violations. This action led to a series of legal challenges and increased scrutiny of Yunus's activities.

At the time of the alleged 2012 events, Dr. Yunus did not issue a public response to the accusations of political involvement. No immediate statement has been issued by Dr. Yunus or his representatives regarding President Hamid's recent recounting of these historical allegations.

President Hamid’s statements have reignited public discussion regarding past political tensions and the role of prominent figures in national affairs. The allegations, disclosed as President Hamid nears the end of his tenure, contribute to the ongoing historical narrative of political dynamics in Bangladesh. Further reactions or official responses to these specific claims remain to be seen.
