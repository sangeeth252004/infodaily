Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is slated to commence an official visit to India on February 26, with high-level discussions anticipated to center on advancing bilateral trade relations and strengthening defence cooperation. The multi-day visit aims to deepen strategic ties between the two nations across various sectors, signaling a concerted effort to enhance their established partnership.

This visit underscores the ongoing efforts by both Canada and India to enhance their economic partnership. A key focus is expected to be the acceleration of negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which aims to significantly boost bilateral trade and investment by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Bilateral trade between Canada and India reached approximately C$12 billion in 2023, representing a substantial foundation for further growth. India, with its large and growing consumer market, is a significant destination for Canadian exports, including pulses, potash, and natural resources. Conversely, Canada serves as an important market for Indian information technology services, pharmaceuticals, and apparel, with potential for increased collaboration in areas like clean energy and artificial intelligence.

Beyond economic considerations, defence cooperation is poised to be a central theme of discussions. Both countries have expressed strategic interest in increasing collaboration in areas such as military training, technology sharing, and joint exercises. This strategic alignment reflects shared interests in regional stability, counter-terrorism efforts, and maritime security, particularly within the broader Indo-Pacific framework. Discussions may include potential joint ventures in defence manufacturing, procurement of military equipment, and enhanced intelligence sharing mechanisms, signaling a deepening of security ties between Ottawa and New Delhi.

Key areas of focus during Prime Minister Carney's visit include:
*   **Trade Agenda:** Accelerating negotiations on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) to enhance market access for goods and services, and address investment protection for mutual benefit.
*   **Defence Cooperation:** Exploring enhanced collaboration in areas such as military training, technology transfer, cyber security, and joint operations, consistent with their shared strategic outlook.
*   **Economic Context:** Bilateral trade between Canada and India recorded approximately C$12 billion in 2023, with substantial untapped potential across sectors like critical minerals, infrastructure, and innovation.
*   **Key Sectors for Discussion:** Agriculture and food processing, clean energy and climate change solutions, digital technology, education, and healthcare infrastructure, highlighting diversification efforts.
*   **High-Level Engagements:** Prime Minister Carney is scheduled to engage in bilateral talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and is also expected to meet with India’s Minister of External Affairs, Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Minister of Defence.

The high-stakes visit is anticipated to conclude with joint statements outlining areas of consensus, new initiatives, and future pathways for bilateral engagement. Outcomes from these discussions could lay the groundwork for significant advancements in trade liberalisation and defence pacts in the coming months, reinforcing the strategic partnership between Canada and India and potentially impacting their respective roles in global affairs.
