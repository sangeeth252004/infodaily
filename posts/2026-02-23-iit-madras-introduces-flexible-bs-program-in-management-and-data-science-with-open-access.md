Chennai, India – The Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) has introduced a new Bachelor of Science (BS) degree program specializing in Management and Data Science. The program distinguishes itself through a flexible, multi-exit structure and an open access admission model designed to broaden participation in high-demand technology fields.

Launched with applications for its inaugural September 2022 batch, the initiative aims to provide accessible, quality education to a diverse group of learners, including students, working professionals, and those seeking to upskill or reskill. The program eliminates traditional entrance examinations and age restrictions, requiring applicants only to pass a qualifying examination.

The flexible nature of the BS program allows students to earn certifications at various stages of completion. Learners can opt to exit with a Certificate, a Diploma, or complete the full Bachelor of Science degree, providing pathways tailored to individual learning goals and career trajectories. This structure is intended to cater to the evolving needs of the workforce and academic aspirations.

Key details of the IIT Madras BS program in Management and Data Science include:
*   **Open Eligibility:** Candidates who have passed Class 12, having studied English and Mathematics in Class 10, are eligible to apply, regardless of their academic stream. This expands access beyond traditional science and engineering backgrounds.
*   **Qualifier Process:** Admission is based on performance in a qualifier exam. Applicants are provided with four weeks of online course content and weekly assignments. Successful completion of these assignments and the final qualifier exam grants admission to the program.
*   **Curriculum:** The program's curriculum is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of both management principles and advanced data science techniques. It covers foundational topics in data science, programming, statistical analysis, and management concepts crucial for business applications.
*   **Online Delivery:** The entire program is delivered online, offering geographical flexibility and allowing individuals to study at their own pace, accommodating both full-time students and working professionals.
*   **Financial Assistance:** IIT Madras has made provisions for economically disadvantaged students. Up to 75% tuition fee waivers are available for candidates from Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Persons with Disabilities (PwD) categories. Scholarships are also offered to support meritorious students.

Professor V. Kamakoti, Director of IIT Madras, emphasized the program's role in addressing the significant demand for skilled professionals in data science and management. He highlighted the institution's commitment to making world-class education accessible to a wider audience, preparing them for future-ready careers. Professor Babu Viswanathan, Dean, Academic Courses, IIT Madras, reiterated the benefits of the multi-entry and multi-exit system, which aligns with modern educational philosophies promoting continuous learning and skill development. Professor Vignesh Muthuvijayan, Professor-in-Charge, Data Science and Applications, further detailed that the curriculum is structured to guide students from foundational concepts to advanced specializations within the domain.

The introduction of this flexible BS program reflects a growing trend in higher education towards blended learning models and skill-focused curricula, particularly in fields with high industry demand like data science. The program is expected to contribute to the national goal of developing a robust, skilled workforce capable of navigating complex data-driven environments.
