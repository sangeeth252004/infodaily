Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to inaugurate the Noida International Airport (NIA) in Jewar, Uttar Pradesh, as confirmed by state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The announcement highlights a significant milestone for the multi-billion dollar aviation project, aimed at bolstering air connectivity and economic development in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Uttar Pradesh. The airport's inauguration will mark the operational readiness of a major infrastructure undertaking in northern India.

The Noida International Airport, also known as Jewar Airport, is designed to serve as the second international airport for the Delhi-NCR metropolitan area, complementing the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in Delhi. Its strategic location in Jewar, Gautam Buddh Nagar district, is expected to alleviate existing air traffic congestion and cater to the growing demand for air travel in northern India. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath emphasized the airport's role in propelling the region's infrastructure growth and attracting investment during a recent public statement.

Development of the Noida International Airport is being undertaken by Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), a 100% subsidiary of Zurich Airport International AG. The project is structured in multiple phases, with the initial phase targeting an annual passenger capacity of 12 million. This phase includes the construction of one runway, a passenger terminal building, and associated airside infrastructure. The overall estimated cost for the entire project, spanning all phases, is approximately ₹29,560 crore. Once fully operational, the airport is projected to feature up to five runways, making it one of India's largest airport facilities by capacity.

The airport's strategic importance extends beyond passenger air travel. It is positioned to become a major logistics and cargo hub, leveraging its proximity to industrial corridors, the proposed Film City, and Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in the region. The increased connectivity is anticipated to stimulate economic activity, generate substantial employment opportunities, and enhance tourism in Uttar Pradesh. Connectivity plans for the airport include extensions of the Delhi Metro line and seamless integration with major expressways like the Yamuna Expressway and the upcoming Ganga Expressway, ensuring efficient access for passengers and cargo alike.

Key project details for the Noida International Airport include:
*   **Developer and Concessionaire:** Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), a subsidiary of Zurich Airport International AG.
*   **Estimated Project Cost:** Approximately ₹29,560 crore (for all phases).
*   **Initial Phase Capacity:** Designed to handle 12 million passengers annually.

*   **Operational Timeline (Phase 1):** Construction is ongoing, with an aim to commence commercial operations by late 2024 or early 2025, subject to project progression and regulatory approvals.

The upcoming inauguration by Prime Minister Modi signals the government's commitment to boosting critical infrastructure and fostering economic development across key regions. While the exact date for the inauguration has not yet been announced, the confirmation from Chief Minister Adityanath underscores the project's advanced stage and its imminent contribution to India's aviation landscape and the broader regional economy. Further phases will continue to expand the airport's capacity and capabilities, solidifying its role as a vital aviation gateway.
