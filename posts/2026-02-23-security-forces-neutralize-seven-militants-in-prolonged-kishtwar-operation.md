Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir have successfully concluded a prolonged counter-terrorism operation in the Kishtwar district, resulting in the neutralization of seven militants over a period spanning 326 days. The extensive multi-agency effort, which involved collaborative intelligence gathering and tactical operations by the Indian Army, Jammu & Kashmir Police (JKP), and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), specifically targeted remnants of militant groups attempting to re-establish presence in the region's challenging high-altitude terrain and dense forests. This sustained campaign marks a significant development in securing the district.

The operation addressed a determined attempt to revive militancy in Kishtwar, an area that had previously been declared terrorism-free. Among the key figures neutralized was Ghulam Sarwar, identified by security officials as the individual attempting to head the revival of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) network in the district. Another significant elimination was Abu Hamas, described as a top JeM commander, whose presence contributed to the organizational efforts of the terror group. These targeted eliminations are considered crucial in dismantling the command structure and disrupting the logistical and recruitment capabilities of the militant ecosystem in Kishtwar.

The success of the operation was attributed to a robust and well-integrated intelligence grid, which facilitated the generation of actionable inputs critical for tracking and engaging militants across the geographically demanding landscape of Kishtwar. Areas such as Palmar, Marwah, and Warwan, known for their harsh weather conditions, including heavy snowfall and often inaccessible terrain, presented formidable challenges for the security personnel. Troops navigated these difficult environments for months, relying on precise intelligence to conduct targeted search and cordon operations. The inter-agency coordination proved instrumental in sustaining the pressure on militant hideouts and movement routes.

The strategic operation involved several key aspects:
*   **Duration:** The campaign extended for 326 consecutive days, indicating a persistent and long-term commitment by security forces.
*   **Militants Neutralized:** A total of seven militants were eliminated during this period.
*   **Key Figures:** Ghulam Sarwar, identified as the head of the JeM revival effort in Kishtwar, and Abu Hamas, a prominent JeM commander, were among those neutralized.
*   **Operational Challenges:** Security forces contended with extreme weather, including heavy snow, high altitudes, dense forests, and remote areas lacking established infrastructure.
*   **Methodology:** The operation relied heavily on human intelligence and technical surveillance, coupled with coordinated ground maneuvers involving multiple security agencies.
*   **Impact:** This concerted effort led to the disruption of militant financing, recruitment, and logistical support networks, thereby weakening the overall terror infrastructure in the Kishtwar region.

The successful conclusion of this extensive counter-terrorism operation reinforces the commitment of security forces to maintaining peace and stability across Jammu and Kashmir. Authorities have indicated that enhanced vigilance and intelligence-led operations will continue to be priorities to prevent any potential resurgence of militant activity. The objective remains the complete dismantling of residual support structures for terrorism and ensuring the long-term security of the region's populace.
