India has formally rolled out PRAHAAR, its first comprehensive anti-terror doctrine, according to an official announcement. This new framework aims to establish a unified and strategic approach to combating various forms of terrorism across the nation. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) concurrently highlighted several major threats that form the core focus of this doctrine, including cross-border terrorism, evolving cyber threats, and the emerging challenge of drone-borne activities.

The introduction of PRAHAAR signifies a strategic consolidation of India's counter-terrorism efforts. As the nation's inaugural overarching doctrine dedicated to this critical area, it is designed to provide clear guidelines and coordinated responses for security agencies at all levels. Its development underscores the government's recognition of the dynamic and multifaceted nature of contemporary terror threats, necessitating a robust and adaptive national security posture.

Key threats identified by the MHA as central to the PRAHAAR doctrine include:

*   **Cross-border Terrorism:** This traditional threat remains a primary concern, encompassing infiltration, financing, and logistical support for terror operations originating from outside India's borders. The doctrine aims to enhance border security measures and intelligence sharing to interdict such activities effectively.
*   **Cyber Threats:** With increasing digital interconnectedness, the potential for cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure, disseminating propaganda, or facilitating terror networks has grown. PRAHAAR seeks to bolster cyber defenses, improve digital forensics capabilities, and disrupt online radicalization efforts.
*   **Drone-borne Threats:** The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents new challenges, from reconnaissance to potential delivery of explosives or illicit goods. The doctrine will address strategies for detection, interception, and neutralization of hostile drone activities.

PRAHAAR is expected to streamline communication, intelligence gathering, and operational responses among various security and intelligence agencies. The doctrine likely emphasizes a multi-agency approach, fostering greater synergy between central and state police forces, intelligence bureaus, and specialized counter-terrorism units. This unified framework is crucial for a nation facing a complex security landscape that demands agile and integrated responses to threats that do not respect traditional jurisdictional boundaries.

Moving forward, the implementation of PRAHAAR will involve rigorous training, resource allocation, and the establishment of new protocols to effectively operationalize its guidelines. The MHA is anticipated to oversee the doctrine's rollout, ensuring its integration into existing security architectures and its continuous adaptation to emerging threat patterns. This comprehensive approach marks a significant step in India's ongoing commitment to strengthening its national security framework against evolving terrorist challenges.
