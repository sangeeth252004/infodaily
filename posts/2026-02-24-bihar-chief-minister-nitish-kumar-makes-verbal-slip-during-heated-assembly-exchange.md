Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recently attracted widespread attention after losing his composure and making a verbal slip during a heated session of the State Legislative Assembly in Patna. During a contentious exchange with opposition members, Mr. Kumar inadvertently stated, "we're 2002," instead of referencing the current period, an incident that quickly circulated across media platforms.

The incident unfolded as opposition legislators pressed the Chief Minister on various governance issues. In response to persistent questioning and interruptions, Mr. Kumar's voice reportedly rose as he admonished the opposition for their conduct and what he perceived as disruptions. It was during this agitated moment that the Chief Minister, in an apparent attempt to emphasize the present political landscape or timeline, misstated the year. While the exact context of his intended statement remained subject to interpretation, the slip where he said "we're 2002" instead of the current year became a focal point of discussion.

Verbal slips by senior political figures in legislative settings often attract scrutiny, as they can be interpreted in various ways by the public and political observers. For some, the incident highlighted the Chief Minister's frustration with the opposition's tactics, while for others, it represented a momentary lapse under the intense pressure of parliamentary debate. The exchange underscored the often-combative nature of legislative proceedings, where leaders are frequently tested under public and media scrutiny.

Key aspects of the incident include:
*   **Setting:** Bihar State Legislative Assembly, during an ongoing session in Patna.
*   **Participants:** Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and opposition legislators.
*   **Nature of Exchange:** Heated debate over governance matters and parliamentary conduct, leading to a visible loss of composure by the Chief Minister.
*   **Specific Remark:** "We're 2002," made in place of the current year, during an agitated response to the opposition.
*   **Dissemination:** Video footage of the exchange was widely shared across digital news platforms and social media, prompting immediate reactions.

The video clip of the exchange quickly spread on social media platforms and news channels, prompting reactions from political commentators and the public alike. Opposition leaders subsequently referenced the incident in their criticism, suggesting it reflected increased irritability or a lapse under pressure from the Chief Minister. Supporters, however, largely dismissed it as an inconsequential error made during an intense debate, emphasizing the demanding environment of legislative proceedings.

While there has been no official statement from the Chief Minister's office specifically addressing the verbal error, the incident quickly became a subject of public and political discussion. Such occurrences in legislative settings frequently highlight the intense scrutiny political figures face and the dynamic nature of parliamentary debates. The event contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding political conduct and communication within the state's legislative arena.
