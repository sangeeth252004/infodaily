Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has publicly commented on the bowling capabilities of Indian all-rounders Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube, following India's performance in the ongoing ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Akhtar's statements, widely reported, specifically questioned the effectiveness of both players' pace bowling, drawing a stark comparison to legendary West Indies pacer Malcolm Marshall.

Akhtar's remarks underscore the scrutiny faced by key players in high-stakes international tournaments. Hardik Pandya, a crucial component of India's squad, is expected to contribute significantly with both bat and ball, often bowling critical overs. Shivam Dube, also an all-rounder, was included in the squad partly for his ability to provide a medium-pace option, adding balance to the team's composition. The former Pakistani cricketer's criticism highlights a perception of a deficit in their bowling potency, particularly in comparison to elite fast bowlers of past eras.

Akhtar articulated his concerns by stating that neither Pandya nor Dube possessed the raw pace or skill synonymous with legendary fast bowlers. He explicitly noted that their bowling lacked the "fire" and intensity required at the international level, suggesting they were not delivering performances akin to cricketing greats. The comments were made during media interactions following a recent match involving the Indian team.

Key points from Shoaib Akhtar's statements include:
*   Akhtar questioned the genuine pace and wicket-taking ability of Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube as bowlers.
*   He used the iconic West Indies fast bowler Malcolm Marshall as a benchmark, stating, "It's not as if they are Malcolm Marshall," to emphasize the perceived gap in class and speed.
*   The criticism focused on the general standard of their bowling, rather than a specific spell or match performance.
*   Akhtar, known for his express pace during his playing career, highlighted what he considered a lack of aggression and cutting edge in their bowling.

These comments contribute to the ongoing discussions surrounding team selections and player performances as the tournament progresses. With the ICC Men's T20 World Cup in full swing, the performance of all-rounders, particularly their contributions in both departments, remains a critical factor for team success. The Indian team's management and players will continue to face examination of their roles and execution in the upcoming matches.
