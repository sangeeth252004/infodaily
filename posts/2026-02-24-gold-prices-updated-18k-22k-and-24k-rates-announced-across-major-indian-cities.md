An official market announcement today provided a detailed update on the prevailing prices for 18K, 22K, and 24K gold across major metropolitan areas in India. These daily figures are crucial for consumers, jewelers, and investors monitoring the precious metals market, reflecting current supply-demand dynamics and global economic influences. The release of these rates offers transparency for transactions involving different purities of gold in key urban centers.

Gold holds significant economic and cultural importance in India, often serving as a traditional investment vehicle and a store of value, particularly during festive seasons and wedding periods. The daily fluctuations in gold prices are influenced by a combination of international and domestic factors. Globally, movements in the US dollar, crude oil prices, and geopolitical events play a role. Domestically, factors such as the strength of the Indian Rupee against the dollar, import duties, and local demand also contribute to price variations. Understanding these daily updates is essential for financial planning and making informed purchasing decisions.

The reported prices differentiate between gold purities, which directly impacts their value and typical applications. 24-karat (24K) gold, representing 99.9% purity, is the purest form and often sought after for investment purposes like coins and bullion. 22-karat (22K) gold, approximately 91.6% pure, is commonly used for crafting jewelry, with the remaining percentage composed of metals like copper and silver to enhance durability. 18-karat (18K) gold, which is 75% pure, is frequently utilized for diamond-studded jewelry and intricate designs due to its greater strength and lower cost compared to higher purities. The lower karat gold contains a higher proportion of alloy metals, resulting in a lower price per gram.

Below are illustrative gold prices for 10 grams of various purities across selected major Indian cities.
