Kristine McDivitt Tompkins, former Chief Executive Officer of the outdoor apparel company Patagonia, has transitioned from a career in corporate leadership to become a pivotal figure in global conservation. Following her tenure at Patagonia, Tompkins dedicated herself to large-scale environmental protection, primarily in the Patagonia region of Chile and Argentina. Her work, through the organization Tompkins Conservation, has directly led to the establishment and expansion of extensive national park systems, contributing to the creation of what stands as one of the world's largest contiguous national park networks.

Tompkins’ journey into conservation began in the early 1990s, after a successful period leading Patagonia. She joined her late husband, entrepreneur and conservationist Douglas Tompkins, in an ambitious initiative to acquire and rewild vast tracts of land across South America. The couple's vision was centered on the ecological restoration of degraded ecosystems, followed by the donation of these lands to governments for permanent designation as national parks. This model aimed to ensure long-term protection and public access to vital natural landscapes.

Under her leadership and vision, Tompkins Conservation has played a significant role in the protection of over 14.8 million acres across Chile and Argentina. This monumental effort has included the creation of 13 new national parks and the expansion of several existing protected areas. These projects have not only safeguarded immense biodiversity but have also contributed to the local economies through ecotourism and sustainable practices. The initiative represents one of the largest private land donations for conservation in history, solidifying a legacy of philanthropy directed towards environmental preservation.

The scope of these conservation efforts extends beyond mere land acquisition. Tompkins Conservation implements extensive rewilding programs aimed at restoring ecological balance by reintroducing native species. These initiatives have seen the return of keystone species such as jaguars, pumas, giant anteaters, huemul deer, and rheas to their historical habitats. The restoration of these apex predators and herbivores is crucial for the health and resilience of the vast Patagonian ecosystems.
