In January 2015, India's National Statistical Office (NSO), under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), announced a significant overhaul of its Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth data calculation methodology. This update introduced a new series of national accounts with 2011-12 as the base year, replacing the previous 2004-05 base. The objective was to enhance the accuracy and relevance of economic data, better reflecting the structural transformations within the Indian economy and aligning its national accounting practices with international standards.

The primary aim of the revised methodology was to provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of economic activity. The previous base year of 2004-05 was deemed outdated given the rapid changes in India's economic structure, including the growth of the services sector and the formalization of certain industries. The shift to a more recent base year of 2011-12 allowed for a re-evaluation of economic weights and contributions, incorporating newer sectors and industries more effectively. This revision also ensured adherence to the latest System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 recommendations, a global statistical framework for national accounting.

The overhaul incorporated several key modifications to data sources and compilation techniques. These adjustments were designed to capture a broader scope of economic activity and improve the granularity of the data being reported.

Key methodological changes and expanded data sources included:
*   **Expanded Corporate Sector Data:** Utilization of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) 21 database for corporate sector data. This moved beyond traditional survey-based methods by incorporating annual filings of over 500,000 companies, providing a more robust and comprehensive view of the organized sector.
*   **Updated Base Year:** Transition of the base year for national accounts from 2004-05 to 2011-12, offering a more current economic benchmark for measuring growth and structural changes.
*   **Inclusion of Local Bodies:** Integration of data from local governing bodies, such as Panchayati Raj Institutions and Municipalities, to capture their economic contribution and expenditure.
*   **Financial Sector Updates:** Incorporation of more granular data from various regulatory bodies for the financial sector, providing a clearer picture of financial intermediation.
*   **Unincorporated Sector Data:** Utilization of results from the latest National Sample Surveys (NSS) specifically covering unincorporated manufacturing and services sectors, which represent a significant portion of the Indian economy.
*   **Manufacturing Sector Methodology:** Implementation of the "Effective Labour Input" method for estimating value added in the manufacturing sector, which replaced the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) factory output as a primary input.
*   **Treatment of Valuables:** Redefinition of "valuables" (such as precious metals and stones) to be treated as capital formation rather than consumption, reflecting their role in investment.
*   **Reclassification of Activities:** Reclassification of certain economic activities; for instance, software was reclassified as a product rather than a service.
*   **Improved FISIM Calculation:** Enhanced methodology for capturing financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM), which represents the value of services provided by financial institutions for which no explicit charges are made.

The immediate impact of the new methodology was evident in the revised historical growth rates. For example, India's GDP growth rate for the fiscal year 2013-14 was restated upwards from an initial estimate of 4.7% (under the 2004-05 series) to 6.9% (under the 2011-12 series). Similarly, the growth for 2012-13 was revised to 5.1%. These revisions indicated a stronger underlying economic performance than previously suggested by the older data series.

This methodological upgrade underscored the continuous effort by statistical authorities to provide accurate and comprehensive economic indicators. Such revisions are crucial for policymakers, businesses, and researchers, offering a more precise foundation for economic analysis, forecasting, and strategic decision-making in a dynamically evolving economy. The NSO periodically reviews and updates its methodologies to reflect current economic realities and maintain international comparability.
