A Pawan Hans helicopter carrying seven individuals, including five passengers and two pilots, crashed into the Andaman Sea off Hutbay, near South Andaman, on Saturday, January 21, 2023, around 9:28 AM. All seven individuals onboard were successfully rescued following the incident.

The twin-engine Dauphin SA 365N3 helicopter was conducting a regular sortie from Port Blair to Hutbay when the incident occurred. Initial reports from Pawan Hans Ltd, a joint venture between the Government of India and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), confirmed the crash and the immediate rescue of all occupants. The rapid response from nearby vessels in the vicinity of the crash site was instrumental in facilitating the swift rescue operation. All individuals were reported to be safe and accounted for after being brought ashore.

Pawan Hans is a key operator of helicopter services in India, providing connectivity to remote and offshore locations, including services in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. The company's fleet is utilized for various purposes, including oil and gas sector support, regional connectivity schemes, and charter services. This incident marks an emergency for the company's operations in a region crucial for air transport.

Following the incident, Pawan Hans Ltd has initiated an internal inquiry to determine the cause of the crash. Concurrently, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India's primary regulatory body for civil aviation, has been informed and is expected to conduct a comprehensive investigation. Such investigations typically involve examining flight data recorders, air traffic control communications, maintenance records, and witness statements to ascertain the factors contributing to the accident.

The successful rescue of all seven occupants underscores the effectiveness of emergency response protocols in the region and the vigilance of vessels operating in the Andaman Sea. Further details regarding the specific cause of the helicopter’s descent are anticipated as the official inquiries progress. The focus of these investigations will be on preventing future occurrences and enhancing aviation safety standards.
