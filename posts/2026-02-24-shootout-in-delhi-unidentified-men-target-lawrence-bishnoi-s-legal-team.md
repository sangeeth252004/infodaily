Authorities are working to piece together the sequence of events and determine the intent behind the targeting of Bishnoi's legal team. The outcome of this investigation will be crucial in addressing the immediate threat and reinforcing confidence in the security framework surrounding the legal profession in India. Further updates are anticipated as the investigation progresses.
