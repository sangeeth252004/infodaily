WASHINGTON D.C. – The U.S. Department of Education has formalized new strategic partnerships with the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the National Governors Association (NGA). Announced recently, these collaborations aim to enhance the efficiency of federal education programs and strengthen efforts to ensure school safety and foster student well-being across the nation.

Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona underscored the importance of working directly with state and local leaders to address the complex challenges facing American education. The department's initiative seeks to transition from bureaucratic processes to tangible impact, facilitating more effective resource utilization and support for schools and districts. The partnerships are designed to provide clearer guidance and foster a more coordinated approach to implementing federal education policies.

The primary objectives of these newly established partnerships include:

*   **Streamlining Federal Programs:** A significant focus is placed on simplifying the administration of federal education initiatives. This includes programs authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The goal is to reduce administrative burdens on states and local education agencies, allowing them to allocate more resources directly to student services and educational improvements.
*   **Boosting School Safety:** Recognizing the ongoing need for secure learning environments, the collaborations will concentrate on developing and implementing best practices for school safety. This encompasses physical security measures, emergency preparedness, and a holistic approach to creating positive school climates that support student mental health and well-being.
*   **Enhancing Program Effectiveness:** By working closely with state education chiefs and governors, the Department aims to ensure that federal funds and programs are maximally effective in meeting the diverse needs of students. This involves sharing successful strategies and developing evidence-based approaches to common educational challenges, particularly in the wake of post-pandemic recovery efforts.

Secretary Cardona emphasized that these partnerships are critical steps toward ensuring all students have access to a high-quality education in safe, supportive environments. The department plans to leverage the expertise and reach of both the CCSSO and NGA to disseminate resources, facilitate peer learning, and gather feedback from practitioners on the ground.

Through these collaborations, the U.S. Education Department anticipates improved coordination between federal, state, and local entities. The next phase will involve working groups and joint initiatives to translate these strategic partnerships into actionable policies and support mechanisms for schools nationwide, with ongoing efforts to monitor their impact and effectiveness on student outcomes and school environments.
