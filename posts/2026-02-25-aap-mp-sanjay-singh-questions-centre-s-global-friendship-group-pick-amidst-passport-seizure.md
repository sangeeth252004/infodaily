Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Member of Parliament Sanjay Singh has publicly questioned the central government's decision to include his name in a global parliamentary 'Friendship Group,' despite his passport being withheld by investigative agencies. Singh, whose travel documents were seized in relation to an ongoing money laundering probe, expressed his bewilderment at the apparent contradiction, stating, "What kind of joke is this?"

The development highlights a peculiar situation for the Rajya Sabha MP, who is currently unable to travel internationally due to the impoundment of his passport by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Parliamentary 'Friendship Groups' are typically formed to foster bilateral relations and enhance diplomatic ties between India's Parliament and legislative bodies of other nations, often involving international visits and exchanges.

Sanjay Singh's passport was seized by the ED as part of an investigation into an alleged money laundering case. The ED, a specialized financial investigative agency, had initiated proceedings against Singh, leading to the impoundment of his travel documents to prevent him from leaving the country while the probe is active. The specific details of the money laundering case are currently under judicial scrutiny.

The MP’s appointment to a global 'Friendship Group' by the Indian Parliament Secretariat, or the relevant parliamentary body, indicates an official acknowledgment of his status as a parliamentarian suitable for international representation. However, the practical implications of such an appointment are undermined by his inability to travel. Singh's public remarks underscore the incongruity between his official parliamentary role in fostering international relations and the legal restrictions placed upon his personal liberty to do so.

Key details surrounding the situation:
*   **Individual Involved:** Sanjay Singh, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) from the Aam Aadmi Party.
*   **Passport Status:** Seized by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering investigation.
*   **Appointment:** Included in an official parliamentary 'Friendship Group,' designed for international parliamentary engagement.
*   **Public Reaction:** Singh expressed surprise and mockery, highlighting the contradiction.

The incident raises questions regarding the internal coordination within governmental bodies when making such parliamentary appointments, particularly concerning individuals facing travel restrictions due to ongoing investigations. While the process for appointing members to 'Friendship Groups' is often procedural, based on parliamentary membership and party representation, the current situation brings administrative oversight into focus.

As of now, there has been no official statement from the central government or the parliamentary secretariat regarding Singh's remarks or the circumstances of his inclusion in the 'Friendship Group' while his passport remains seized. The ongoing legal proceedings related to the money laundering case are expected to continue, determining the future status of his travel documents and, by extension, his ability to participate in international parliamentary engagements.
