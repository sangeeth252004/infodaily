Egyptian authorities have arrested a tour guide following the circulation of a viral video depicting him allegedly sketching on the Great Pyramid of Giza, a monument estimated to be over 4,000 years old. The incident, which drew widespread attention and condemnation on social media platforms, occurred at the Giza Necropolis, a UNESCO World Heritage site located near Cairo.

The arrested individual has been identified as Karim Badr. The video, which rapidly gained traction online, shows Badr appearing to draw with what resembled chalk or a similar implement on the ancient stone blocks of the pyramid. The nature of the "sketching" and its potential for permanent impact on the historical structure are currently under investigation. Following the video's dissemination and a significant public outcry, Egypt's Tourism and Antiquities Police initiated an immediate investigation, leading to Badr's swift apprehension. He now faces charges related to violating strict national regulations designed to safeguard historical sites and cultural property.

The Great Pyramid of Giza stands as the largest and oldest of the three pyramids in the Giza Necropolis, an iconic symbol of ancient Egyptian civilization and an unparalleled architectural achievement. Built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty, its construction dates back to approximately 2580–2560 BC. As a designated UNESCO World Heritage site since 1979, the entire Giza plateau is subject to stringent international and national protection measures. These regulations aim to preserve the integrity, authenticity, and universal value of these irreplaceable monuments for future generations. Egypt has robust laws, such as Law No. 117 of 1983 concerning the protection of antiquities, which criminalize actions that damage, deface, or alter archaeological sites.

Egypt Experience, a tourism company with which Karim Badr was reportedly affiliated, promptly issued a statement regarding the incident. The company unequivocally condemned the alleged act, clarifying that Badr operated as an independent contractor, not a direct employee. The statement also affirmed that Egypt Experience would cease any further affiliation with Badr, underscoring its commitment to ethical tourism practices and the profound importance of respecting and preserving Egypt's invaluable historical treasures. The company emphasized its dedication to upholding the highest standards of cultural responsibility.

The incident has ignited renewed discussions regarding responsible tourism practices, the power of social media in oversight, and the ongoing challenges of protecting ancient monuments from potential damage or disregard. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the exact circumstances surrounding the alleged sketching and its potential long-term effects. Badr is expected to undergo legal proceedings to determine culpability and the appropriate penalties under Egyptian law. This case serves as a stark reminder of Egypt's resolute stance against any actions that threaten its archaeological heritage, which forms a vital part of both national identity and global human history.
