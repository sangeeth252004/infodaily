Benjamin Netanyahu, then serving as Israel's Opposition leader, publicly commended Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a virtual event on October 28, 2022. Netanyahu lauded PM Modi's global recognition, specifically referencing his "hug known around the world," and characterized India as a "gigantic power." The remarks underscored the personal rapport between the two leaders and the growing strategic importance of the India-Israel relationship.

The statements were made during a virtual conference titled "The Future of India-Israel Relations," an event focused on bilateral ties. Netanyahu, who had previously served as Israel's Prime Minister from 2009 to 2021, highlighted the strength of the partnership forged during his tenure and expressed optimism for its continued development. His comments, delivered while he was campaigning to return to the premiership, reinforced the widely recognized personal chemistry that has defined the relationship between the two nations' leaders.

The "Modi hug" reference has become a notable symbol of PM Modi's diplomatic style, often employed during meetings with world leaders. Netanyahu's acknowledgement of this gesture indicates its global recognition and how it symbolizes a particular approach to international diplomacy. Furthermore, labeling India a "gigantic power" reflects a broader international recognition of India's escalating economic, geopolitical, and strategic influence on the global stage.

The bilateral relationship between India and Israel has seen significant growth in recent years, marked by high-level visits and increased cooperation across various sectors.

Key milestones and areas of collaboration include:
*   **Historic Visits:** Prime Minister Modi's landmark visit to Israel in July 2017 marked the first time an Indian Prime Minister visited the nation. This was reciprocated by then-Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to India in January 2018.
*   **Defence Cooperation:** Defence and security have historically been pillars of the relationship, with Israel becoming a key supplier of advanced defence technology to India.
*   **Technology and Innovation:** Both nations have fostered collaborations in innovation, cybersecurity, and startups, recognizing each other's strengths in the technology sector.
*   **Agriculture and Water Management:** Joint projects and technological transfers in agriculture and water conservation have significantly benefited both countries, addressing critical resource challenges.

Netanyahu's remarks in October 2022, ahead of his successful return as Prime Minister of Israel, served to reaffirm the deep foundations of the India-Israel strategic partnership. The public praise from a prominent global leader like Netanyahu underscores India's rising stature and the enduring value placed on its bilateral relations. The statement suggests that despite political transitions in both countries, the trajectory of cooperation between India and Israel is expected to remain robust, driven by shared interests and mutual respect.
