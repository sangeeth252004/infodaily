Afghan forces, operating under the interim Taliban administration, initiated retaliatory artillery and rocket strikes against Pakistani military outposts along the disputed border on Monday, March 21, 2022. These actions followed earlier airstrikes conducted by Pakistan within Afghanistan's Khost and Kunar provinces, which Islamabad stated targeted hideouts of the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group. The rapid escalation in cross-border hostilities has significantly heightened tensions between the two neighboring nations.

The Pakistani airstrikes, which occurred in the early hours of Monday, reportedly resulted in civilian casualties in the Spera district of Khost province and the Shaltan district of Kunar province. Local Afghan officials and residents reported at least 47 civilian fatalities, including women and children. The Pakistani foreign office confirmed conducting operations against "terrorists" but did not specify the nature or location of these actions, stating that terrorists were using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistan.

Following the Pakistani air raids, Afghan security forces responded by directing heavy weaponry towards several Pakistani military checkpoints. The strikes were concentrated in areas along the porous border, which has long been a flashpoint for disputes and cross-border movements of militants. Afghan officials condemned Pakistan's airstrikes as an act of aggression and a violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty, vowing to defend their territory.

Key details of the recent escalation include:
*   **Pakistani Airstrikes:** Targeted alleged TTP hideouts in Afghanistan's Khost and Kunar provinces.
*   **Afghan Response:** Artillery and rocket attacks against Pakistani military outposts.
*   **Casualties:** Reports indicate dozens of civilian deaths in Afghanistan from the Pakistani airstrikes.
*   **Diplomatic Fallout:** The interim Afghan government summoned Pakistan’s ambassador to lodge a formal protest against the airstrikes, denouncing them as "tyranny."
*   **Border Closures:** The Torkham and Chaman border crossings, vital trade routes, were temporarily closed, disrupting commercial activities and movement of people.

The TTP, often referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, is a separate entity from the Afghan Taliban but shares ideological ties. Pakistan has consistently urged the Taliban administration in Afghanistan to prevent TTP militants from using Afghan territory to plan and execute attacks within Pakistan. The Afghan Taliban, while acknowledging the issue, has stated its commitment to not allowing any group to threaten neighboring countries from Afghan soil, but insists on resolving such matters through dialogue rather than military force.

The recent clashes underscore the fragile security situation along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and the persistent challenges both nations face in managing militant groups operating in the region. The immediate future outlook indicates a need for de-escalation through diplomatic channels to prevent further military engagements that could destabilize an already volatile region. Observers are monitoring whether a sustained dialogue can be established to address Pakistan's security concerns regarding the TTP and uphold Afghanistan's sovereignty.
