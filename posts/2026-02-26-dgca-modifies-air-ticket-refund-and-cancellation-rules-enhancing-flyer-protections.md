NEW DELHI – India's aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), announced updated air ticket refund and cancellation rules on October 22, 2022, introducing significant changes aimed at enhancing consumer protection and streamlining refund processes. The revised regulations primarily focus on providing a 48-hour free cancellation window for passengers and establishing clear deadlines for airlines to process refunds, addressing long-standing grievances from air travelers.

The new directives mandate that airlines must offer a full refund without any cancellation charges if a ticket is cancelled within 48 hours of booking. This provision applies to tickets booked at least seven days prior to the scheduled date of departure. This change is designed to provide passengers with a greater degree of flexibility and a window to review their travel plans shortly after purchase without financial penalty. Previously, cancellation charges could be applied from the moment of booking, regardless of the short timeframe between booking and cancellation.

In addition to the free cancellation window, the DGCA has set definitive timelines for airlines to process refund requests. This measure seeks to eliminate delays in passengers receiving their money back, which has been a recurring issue across the sector.

Key refund processing timelines include:

*   **Credit Card Transactions:** Airlines are now required to process refund amounts for tickets purchased via credit card within seven working days of receiving the cancellation request.
*   **Cash Transactions:** For tickets purchased with cash, airlines must process and disburse refunds within 20 calendar days of receiving the cancellation request.
*   **Other Payment Methods:** Refunds for tickets purchased through other payment methods, such as bank transfers or digital wallets, are also subject to specific deadlines that vary based on the payment gateway, typically aiming for similar prompt processing.

These regulatory amendments underscore the DGCA's commitment to ensuring greater transparency and accountability within the Indian aviation sector. The changes are expected to significantly benefit millions of flyers by standardizing airline practices and mitigating financial risks associated with sudden changes in travel plans or protracted refund procedures. Prior to these updates, the absence of clear, universally enforced deadlines often led to passengers experiencing substantial waits for their refunds, sometimes extending over several weeks or months.

Airlines operating in India are now required to integrate these new rules into their booking and cancellation systems. The DGCA is expected to monitor airline compliance with these revised guidelines to ensure the intended benefits reach passengers effectively. These changes represent a notable step towards strengthening consumer rights in the country's rapidly growing air travel market.
