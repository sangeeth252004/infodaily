NEW DELHI – Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has publicly addressed the controversy surrounding alleged omissions of judiciary-related content from National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks. Speaking in October 2022, Minister Pradhan emphasized his "utmost respect for the judiciary" and stated that any content perceived as missing was likely due to temporary adjustments made during the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than permanent deletions. He further assured that appropriate action would be taken to ensure all relevant content is included.

The statement by Minister Pradhan aimed to clarify the government's stance amidst public and judicial scrutiny regarding the content rationalisation process undertaken by NCERT. Reports and public discourse had highlighted instances where certain chapters and sections, including those pertaining to the Indian judiciary, appeared to have been removed or altered in revised editions of textbooks. This sparked concerns about the completeness and historical accuracy of the curriculum provided to students nationwide.

Key points from the Minister's statement and the surrounding controversy include:
*   **Temporary Adjustments:** Minister Pradhan asserted that decisions to drop certain content were primarily made to reduce the academic burden on students during the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated curriculum adjustments.
*   **Respect for Judiciary:** He unequivocally expressed the government's reverence for the Indian judiciary, countering any perception that content related to it was deliberately removed to undermine its role or historical significance.
*   **Vow for Action:** The Minister committed to reviewing the textbooks and ensuring that any content relevant to the judiciary that might be missing due to these temporary measures would be promptly restored. This indicated a proactive approach to address the concerns raised.
*   **NCERT's Role:** The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Education, responsible for advising the central and state governments on academic matters, particularly in school education, and for preparing and publishing textbooks.

The controversy reflects broader debates about curriculum development and the interpretation of historical and political content in educational materials. Critics had pointed to a pattern of content rationalisation that, they argued, selectively removed chapters on topics such as democracy, secularism, and specific historical events, alongside concerns about judiciary-related sections. These changes often led to accusations of revisionism and politicization of education.

Following the Minister's assurance, stakeholders will be monitoring the implementation of the promised review and the subsequent re-inclusion of any identified missing content. The NCERT is expected to provide further clarity on its rationalisation process and the timeline for any textbook revisions. This ongoing situation underscores the significant public and governmental interest in maintaining the integrity and comprehensive nature of educational content in India.
