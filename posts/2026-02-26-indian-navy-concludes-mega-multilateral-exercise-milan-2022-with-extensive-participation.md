The Indian Navy successfully concluded MILAN 2022, its flagship biennial multilateral naval exercise, in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, from February 25 to March 4, 2022. The extensive exercise saw the participation of 42 warships, including submarines, and 29 aircraft from 39 friendly foreign nations alongside Indian naval assets, marking one of the largest naval congregations in the region. The event underscored India's commitment to fostering maritime cooperation and strengthening regional security architecture.

MILAN 2022 served as a crucial platform for participating navies to enhance interoperability, share best practices, and gain insights into contemporary maritime challenges. The exercise was structured into two main phases: a 'Harbour Phase' and a 'Sea Phase'. The Harbour Phase, held from February 25 to 28, focused on professional interactions, subject matter expert exchanges, cultural events, and sporting fixtures, facilitating robust diplomatic and personal connections among the contingents. This phase also included an International City Parade and a Chief of Naval Staff's conference, which brought together naval chiefs and high-level delegations to discuss strategies for maritime security.

The subsequent Sea Phase, conducted from March 1 to 4 in the Bay of Bengal, involved complex and advanced naval operations. This operational segment provided a realistic environment for navies to execute coordinated maneuvers and refine their tactical skills. Exercises ranged from anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-surface warfare (ASuW) drills to advanced air defense exercises, gunnery shoots, and cross-deck helicopter operations. The collaborative nature of these drills aimed to improve collective responses to potential maritime threats, including piracy, terrorism, and illegal fishing.

Key details of MILAN 2022 included:
*   **Participation:** Naval forces from 39 nations, including the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and South Korea, joined the Indian Navy.
*   **Assets Deployed:** A total of 42 warships and submarines, alongside 29 aircraft, were actively involved in the exercises. These included destroyers, frigates, corvettes, offshore patrol vessels, submarines, helicopters, and maritime patrol aircraft.
*   **Focus Areas:** The operational drills specifically targeted enhancing communication protocols, tactical understanding, and the ability to operate seamlessly in a multinational environment.
*   **Host Nation Capabilities:** The Indian Navy showcased its operational readiness, logistical capabilities, and expertise in coordinating large-scale multilateral exercises, reinforcing its role as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region.

The conclusion of MILAN 2022 marked a significant milestone in international maritime cooperation. The exercise not only demonstrated the collective resolve of participating nations to uphold a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific but also laid the groundwork for future collaborative engagements. As a biennial event, MILAN is expected to continue evolving, reflecting the dynamic nature of global maritime security challenges and the growing need for concerted efforts to address them. The successful execution of MILAN 2022 reinforces its position as a premier naval exercise for forging enduring partnerships among global navies.
