O. Panneerselvam (OPS), a prominent figure in Tamil Nadu politics and former Chief Minister, was reportedly considering joining the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Friday, September 23, 2022. Sources close to the development indicated that the potential move was primarily aimed at challenging his political rival, Edappadi K. Palaniswami (EPS), amidst an escalating power struggle within the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). This reported realignment could significantly alter the political landscape of Tamil Nadu, potentially deepening the fragmentation within the opposition AIADMK.

The reported consideration by OPS comes against the backdrop of a protracted internal conflict within the AIADMK, which intensified following the demise of former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa in 2016. Both OPS and EPS have since vied for control of the party, leading to a fragmented leadership and numerous legal disputes. OPS's potential shift to the DMK, the state's current ruling party under Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, would represent a dramatic political realignment, given his decades-long association with the AIADMK.

The feud between OPS and EPS escalated after the AIADMK's general council, in July 2022, passed resolutions that effectively expelled OPS from the party and reinstated EPS as the interim general secretary. OPS has subsequently contested these decisions in court, asserting his claim to the party's leadership and challenging the validity of the general council meeting. His reported potential alignment with the DMK would provide him with a new platform to counter Palaniswami's authority and influence within Tamil Nadu politics, potentially offering a strategic advantage in the ongoing power struggle.

Key details surrounding this development include:
*   **Background of O. Panneerselvam:** OPS has served as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu three times (2001-2002, 2014-2015, 2016-2017) during periods of political uncertainty or legal issues faced by J. Jayalalithaa. He was historically regarded as a loyalist to Jayalalithaa.
*   **AIADMK Power Struggle:** The leadership tussle between OPS and EPS has involved multiple legal challenges, including disputes over the party's unitary leadership structure and the legitimacy of resolutions passed by the general council.
*   **DMK's Position:** The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam secured a majority in the 2021 Assembly elections, forming the government under M.K. Stalin. A move by OPS could potentially bolster the DMK's strategic positioning or further disrupt the AIADMK's internal cohesion ahead of future elections.

Political observers in Tamil Nadu are closely monitoring for any official statements or confirmations regarding OPS's reported decision. If confirmed, such a development could significantly alter the dynamics of opposition politics in the state, potentially weakening the AIADMK's unified front further. It would also raise questions about future political alliances and the long-term impact on the state's two dominant Dravidian parties and their respective electoral strategies. The coming days are expected to bring more clarity on this evolving political situation.
