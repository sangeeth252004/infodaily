Pakistan's security forces initiated "Operation Ghazab Lil Haq" in October 2022, a significant counter-terrorism campaign following a series of deadly militant attacks attributed to groups operating from Afghan soil. The operation was launched amidst heightened tensions along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with reports indicating that at least 55 Pakistani civilians had been killed in these cross-border incidents.

The primary target of "Operation Ghazab Lil Haq" is the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its various affiliate organizations. These groups are designated as terrorist entities and have been responsible for numerous acts of violence within Pakistan. The launch of the operation underscores Pakistan's resolve to address the persistent threat of militancy emanating from across its western border.

*   **Operation Name:** Ghazab Lil Haq (meaning 'Wrath for Truth')
*   **Launch Period:** October 2022
*   **Primary Target:** Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates
*   **Reason for Launch:** Response to militant attacks from Afghanistan, reportedly causing 55 civilian casualties.
*   **Nature of Operation:** Described as a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign, involving intelligence-based operations and targeted actions.

The decision to launch this operation came after Pakistan experienced a surge in terrorist activities, with authorities frequently attributing these assaults to militants who allegedly find safe haven or operational bases within Afghanistan. The reported deaths of 55 civilians in attacks originating from Afghan territory served as a critical catalyst for the intensified military response. Pakistan has repeatedly urged the interim Afghan government to take decisive action against all terrorist groups operating from its soil, a call that has been a recurring point of contention in bilateral relations.

The operational areas are primarily concentrated along the Pak-Afghan border regions, where militant hideouts and infiltration routes are suspected to be present. Pakistani officials have emphasized that the operation aims to dismantle the infrastructure used by these terrorist groups to plan and execute attacks on Pakistani soil. The cross-border nature of the threat complicates regional security dynamics, leading to frequent diplomatic exchanges and at times, direct military responses.

The unfolding of "Operation Ghazab Lil Haq" is poised to significantly impact the already fragile security situation in the region. Pakistan maintains that addressing the root causes of terrorism and ensuring that no territory is used against its interests is paramount for regional stability. The future trajectory of this operation, alongside the diplomatic engagement between Islamabad and Kabul, will be critical in determining the security landscape of the Pak-Afghan border and the broader South Asian region. International observers continue to monitor developments closely for their implications on counter-terrorism efforts and regional peace.
