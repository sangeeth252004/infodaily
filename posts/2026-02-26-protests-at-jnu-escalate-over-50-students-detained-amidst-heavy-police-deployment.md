NEW DELHI – More than 50 students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) were detained by Delhi Police on Thursday following an escalation of protests against proposed hostel fee increases and new residential regulations. The detentions occurred amidst heavy police deployment in and around the university campus, as students attempted to march towards the administrative block and possibly beyond.

The protests, which began earlier this week, intensified as students voiced strong opposition to a proposed significant hike in hostel fees and the implementation of new curfew timings and restrictions on common areas. Student organizations argue that these measures would make education less accessible for many and infringe upon student freedoms. The JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) had called for a campus-wide demonstration, culminating in a planned march.

The situation escalated late morning when students reportedly attempted to breach barricades set up by security personnel near the main administrative building. Delhi Police, along with paramilitary forces, were heavily deployed to manage the crowd and prevent the demonstration from moving off-campus towards central Delhi. The police utilized barricades and deployed personnel at key entry and exit points of the university and its surrounding areas.

Key details regarding the incident include:
*   **Detentions:** Over 50 students, including several JNUSU office-bearers, were taken into custody. They were transported to various police stations across Delhi, including Vasant Kunj North and South.
*   **Police Presence:** Multiple platoons of Delhi Police, including Quick Reaction Teams and women constabulary, were deployed. Drone surveillance was also reportedly used to monitor the crowd.
*   **Student Demands:** Protestors are demanding an immediate rollback of the proposed fee hike and withdrawal of the new hostel regulations, citing concerns over affordability and student autonomy.
*   **Traffic Disruption:** The heavy police presence and student gathering caused significant traffic disruptions on roads leading to the JNU campus and nearby areas for several hours.

A spokesperson for the Delhi Police stated that the detentions were made to maintain law and order and prevent public disturbance. They emphasized that students were repeatedly asked to disperse peacefully before action was taken. JNU administration officials have yet to issue an official statement regarding the detentions or the future of the proposed regulations, though previous statements from the administration have cited rising operational costs as a reason for potential fee adjustments.

As of Thursday evening, most detained students were reportedly awaiting release after legal formalities. The JNUSU has indicated it plans to continue its agitation until their demands are met, suggesting further protests may occur in the coming days. Security measures around the JNU campus are expected to remain heightened.
