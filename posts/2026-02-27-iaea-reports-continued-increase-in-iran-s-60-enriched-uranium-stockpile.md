The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported a significant increase in Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, according to its latest confidential reports. This development highlights the continued expansion of Iran's nuclear activities and has heightened ongoing concerns among international powers regarding the country's nuclear program. The agency's findings were formally communicated to member states, detailing the growth of the highly enriched material at Iranian facilities.

Uranium enriched to 60% purity is considered a short technical step away from weapons-grade material, which typically requires enrichment to around 90%. This level of enrichment far exceeds the 3.67% limit established by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers. The accumulation of such highly enriched material raises serious proliferation risks and complicates efforts to revive the stalled diplomatic process aimed at restoring the nuclear deal.

The IAEA's reports have provided concrete figures on the escalating reserves:
*   As of February 2024, Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% stood at approximately 128.3 kilograms.
*   This quantity marks a notable increase from the roughly 121.6 kilograms reported by the agency in November 2023.
*   The IAEA estimates that 25.8 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60% purity could be further enriched to a "theoretical amount of 25.8 kg of uranium enriched to 90% purity," which is a 'significant quantity' defined by the agency as the approximate amount of nuclear material from which the manufacture of a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded.

Iran began systematically breaching the terms of the JCPOA in 2019, following the United States' withdrawal from the agreement in 2018 and the re-imposition of sanctions. Tehran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, including medical isotopes and energy production, despite enriching uranium to levels substantially beyond those required for commercial nuclear power generation.

The escalating accumulation of highly enriched uranium has been a central point of contention in international diplomacy, particularly in attempts to restore the JCPOA. Discussions aimed at bringing both the U.S. and Iran back into full compliance with the accord have remained deadlocked. The IAEA continues its monitoring efforts in Iran, although Tehran has imposed limitations on certain surveillance measures previously agreed upon under the JCPOA, further complicating the agency's oversight capabilities. The international community is expected to maintain pressure on Iran through diplomatic channels and existing sanctions, with future developments largely dependent on renewed negotiations and Iran's willingness to re-engage with the terms of a verifiable agreement.
