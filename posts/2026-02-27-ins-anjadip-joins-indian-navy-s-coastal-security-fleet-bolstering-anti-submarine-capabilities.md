The Indian Navy has officially inducted INS Anjadip, an advanced Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Craft (ASW SWC), into its coastal security fleet. The commissioning ceremony, held on December 19, 2023, at the Naval Dockyard in Visakhapatnam, marks a significant enhancement to the Navy's capabilities in detecting and neutralizing underwater threats in littoral waters. This event follows its successful completion of sea trials and delivery from Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata.

INS Anjadip is the third vessel in a series of eight ASW SWC projects sanctioned by the Ministry of Defence. Its primary role is to conduct anti-submarine operations in coastal areas and shallow waters, replacing the aging Abhay-class ASW corvettes. The vessel is designed to provide effective anti-submarine warfare capabilities, including surveillance, pursuit, and engagement of enemy submarines. Its induction is critical for safeguarding India's extensive coastline, island territories, and offshore assets from potential underwater threats.

Key details regarding INS Anjadip and its capabilities include:

*   **Design and Construction:** The vessel has been designed by the Indian Navy's Directorate of Naval Design and built by GRSE, underscoring India's growing self-reliance in naval shipbuilding. The project aligns with the 'Make in India' initiative, with approximately 80% indigenous content.
*   **Dimensions and Displacement:** INS Anjadip measures approximately 77.6 meters in length and has a displacement of around 900 tons. It is engineered for optimal maneuverability and stealth in its operational environment.
*   **Propulsion and Speed:** Powered by a modern propulsion system, the craft is capable of achieving speeds in excess of 25 knots, enabling rapid deployment and response.
*   **Armament and Sensors:** Equipped with advanced sonar systems, torpedo launchers, and anti-submarine rockets, INS Anjadip possesses the necessary firepower to neutralize underwater threats. Its sensor suite includes state-of-the-art communication and navigation systems to support its missions.
*   **Mission Versatility:** Beyond its primary ASW role, the vessel is also capable of undertaking mine laying operations, sub-surface surveillance, search and rescue missions, and low-intensity maritime operations. Its design emphasizes operational flexibility and adaptability to various maritime security challenges.
*   **Crew Complement:** The craft is manned by a crew of approximately 57 personnel, including officers and sailors, trained to operate its sophisticated systems.

The induction of INS Anjadip is part of a broader strategic effort by the Indian Navy to modernize its fleet and strengthen its maritime defence architecture. The ASW SWC project aims to build a robust force capable of responding to the evolving regional security landscape and increasing submarine proliferation. These vessels are expected to play a crucial role in securing vital sea lanes and protecting India's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Following its commissioning, INS Anjadip will undergo further integration into the Eastern Naval Command's operational readiness cycle. This includes extensive training exercises and joint drills with other naval assets to ensure full operational capability. The remaining vessels of the ASW SWC series are expected to be delivered in a phased manner over the coming years, further enhancing the Indian Navy's capacity to maintain maritime dominance and secure its strategic interests.
