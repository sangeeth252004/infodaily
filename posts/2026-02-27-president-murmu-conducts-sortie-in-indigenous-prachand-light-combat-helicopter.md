President Droupadi Murmu, the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces, undertook a maiden sortie in the indigenous Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) 'Prachand' on Saturday, April 13, 2024. The flight occurred at Tezpur Air Force Station in Assam, underscoring India's advancing capabilities in defense manufacturing and the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India) initiative. The President's participation in the sortie highlights a significant endorsement of domestically developed military platforms.

The sortie, lasting approximately 30 minutes, saw President Murmu in the front co-pilot seat of the advanced attack helicopter. Group Captain Naveen Kumar piloted the aircraft, navigating it over the Brahmaputra River and the Tezpur valley. Following the flight, President Murmu expressed her admiration for the LCH 'Prachand' and commended the Indian Air Force for its professionalism and dedication to national security. She described the experience as exhilarating and conveyed her immense pride in the country's indigenous defense prowess.

The Light Combat Helicopter 'Prachand' represents a major milestone in India's journey towards self-reliance in critical defense technologies. Developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the LCH is India's first indigenously designed and manufactured attack helicopter. It is specifically engineered to operate in high-altitude environments, a crucial requirement for India's diverse geographical and strategic needs, particularly along its northern borders. The helicopter's design incorporates features enabling it to effectively engage ground targets, conduct counter-insurgency operations, and perform search and rescue missions in challenging terrains.

Key details regarding the LCH 'Prachand' and the President's sortie include:
*   **Design and Manufacture:** Fully designed and developed in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).
*   **Operational Capability:** Designed for high-altitude warfare, capable of operating at altitudes over 15,000 feet.
*   **Armament:** Equipped with a range of armaments including a 20 mm turret gun, 70 mm rocket pods, and air-to-air missiles.
*   **Induction:** Formally inducted into the Indian Air Force (IAF) in October 2022 and the Indian Army in November 2022.
*   **Presidential Role:** President Murmu serves as the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces, a role that traditionally entails reviewing military parades and overseeing strategic defense matters. This sortie marks a direct engagement with an operational indigenous asset.

The President's flight in the 'Prachand' is viewed as a symbolic gesture reinforcing the government's commitment to strengthening indigenous defense production. It serves to boost the morale of defense personnel and engineers involved in India's 'Make in India' defense sector, while also showcasing the reliability and advanced capabilities of Indian-made military hardware to potential international buyers. This event further solidifies India's position as a burgeoning hub for defense innovation and manufacturing.
