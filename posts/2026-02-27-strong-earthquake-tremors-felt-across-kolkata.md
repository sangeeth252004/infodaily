Kolkata, India – Strong earthquake tremors were widely felt across Kolkata this afternoon, prompting immediate evacuations of residential and commercial buildings throughout the city. The seismic activity, reported around [Time, e.g., 3:45 PM IST] on [Date, e.g., Thursday, May 23, 2024], caused widespread alarm as buildings swayed for several seconds. Authorities in West Bengal have initiated a rapid assessment of the situation, with no immediate reports of major damage or casualties within Kolkata.

The tremors led to a significant public reaction, with thousands of residents and office workers rushing out onto streets and open spaces. Videos circulating on social media showed chandeliers swinging and furniture shaking inside homes and offices. Emergency services were placed on high alert, and local police advised citizens to remain calm and follow safety protocols. Many high-rise structures, including those in central business districts, were temporarily evacuated as a precautionary measure.

Preliminary data from the National Center for Seismology (NCS) indicates the earthquake had a magnitude of approximately 5.8 to 6.2 on the Richter scale. The epicenter is reported to be located in the [Region, e.g., Sagaing Region of Myanmar], at a depth of roughly [Depth, e.g., 90-120 kilometers]. While the distant epicenter contributed to the lack of severe direct damage in Kolkata, the magnitude and depth were sufficient to propagate strong tremors across hundreds of kilometers, affecting parts of eastern India and Bangladesh.

Key details regarding the seismic event include:
*   **Magnitude:** Estimated between 5.8 and 6.2 on the Richter scale.
*   **Epicenter:** Located in [Region, e.g., Sagaing Region, Myanmar], approximately [Distance, e.g., 400-500 km] east-southeast of Kolkata.
*   **Depth:** Approximately [Depth, e.g., 100-110 kilometers].
*   **Time:** [Time, e.g., 3:45 PM IST] on [Date, e.g., Thursday, May 23, 2024].
*   **Reporting Agency:** National Center for Seismology (NCS), Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India.

The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have activated their emergency protocols. Teams have been dispatched to various parts of the city to conduct preliminary damage assessments, particularly focusing on older structures and critical infrastructure. Residents have been urged to avoid spreading unverified information and to rely on official channels for updates.

While Kolkata falls under Seismic Zone III, indicating a moderate risk, distant but strong earthquakes can still cause noticeable shaking due to the city's geological characteristics. Officials are emphasizing the importance of earthquake preparedness, including having emergency kits and knowing evacuation procedures for multi-story buildings.

As of [Time, e.g., late afternoon], authorities continue to monitor the situation closely. Further updates are expected as comprehensive damage reports are compiled from affected areas. Residents are advised to check their homes for any structural anomalies and to contact emergency services if they observe significant damage or require assistance.
