Harvard University's Department of South Asian Studies recently issued a formal apology following criticism over an "insensitive image" used to promote an upcoming Sanskrit language course. The image, which depicted the Hindu deity Lord Shiva smoking a chillum, was featured in promotional materials for the course, leading to significant backlash from various online communities regarding its perceived cultural and religious disrespect. The apology was published on the department's official website in late November 2023.

The controversy began when promotional content for the course, titled "Sanskrit and the Civilisational Discourses of India," circulated across social media platforms. Observers, particularly within the Hindu community globally, swiftly voiced strong objections. Critics argued that portraying Lord Shiva, a principal deity in Hinduism, in association with substance use was a misrepresentation and an inappropriate depiction of a revered religious figure, especially within an academic context aiming to teach ancient Indian culture and language. Concerns were raised about the responsibility of educational institutions to demonstrate cultural and religious sensitivity when engaging with diverse traditions.

In response to the widespread criticism, the Department of South Asian Studies acknowledged the offense caused by the image and issued its apology. The official statement, as quoted from the department's website, read: "We are writing to acknowledge and sincerely apologize for the offense caused by the image used to promote our upcoming Sanskrit language course, 'Sanskrit and the Civilisational Discourses of India.' The image, depicting Lord Shiva smoking a chillum, was insensitive and inappropriate. We understand the deep reverence many hold for Lord Shiva and Hinduism, and we unequivocally affirm our respect for all religious traditions." The department further clarified that the use of the image was unintentional in its offensive impact and reiterated its commitment to respectful engagement with all cultural and religious traditions in its academic endeavors.

The incident underscores broader discussions within academia regarding the balance between academic freedom and cultural sensitivity, particularly when dealing with religious and cultural symbols. Sanskrit is an ancient Indo-Aryan language that forms the foundation of many philosophical, religious, and literary texts in India, including those central to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Lord Shiva is one of the most revered deities in the Hindu pantheon, often associated with meditation, creation, and destruction. While certain folk traditions or interpretations may depict Shiva with a chillum, the context of an academic promotional image for a Sanskrit course was widely deemed disrespectful by critics.

Following the apology, the university department confirmed the removal of the contentious image from all promotional materials. This event highlights the increasing scrutiny educational institutions face regarding their representation of diverse cultures and religions. It serves as a notable instance of a major academic institution formally apologizing for a perceived cultural misstep, prompting ongoing conversations about best practices for cultural depiction and ensuring respectful engagement in global educational contexts.
