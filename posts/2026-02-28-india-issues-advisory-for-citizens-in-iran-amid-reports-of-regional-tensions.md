India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a comprehensive advisory on November 28, 2023, urging all Indian nationals residing in or travelling to Iran to exercise utmost caution. The directive came amidst heightened regional tensions and circulating reports regarding potential military actions in the vicinity of Tehran. The MEA also announced the release of a dedicated helpline number by the Indian Embassy in Tehran to assist its citizens.

The advisory underscores the Indian government's commitment to the safety and well-being of its expatriate community and travellers in the Middle East. It specifically directs Indian nationals to prioritize their personal security and adhere to local safety guidelines given the prevailing geopolitical climate.

The region has witnessed a period of escalating tensions, with various international media outlets reporting on potential US and Israel-linked activities near the Iranian capital. While the advisory did not directly specify the nature of these reports, it implicitly acknowledged the need for increased vigilance among the Indian populace in Iran. Such proactive measures are standard protocol for governments worldwide to safeguard their citizens in areas experiencing political instability or security concerns.

The Indian community in Iran constitutes a significant presence, encompassing professionals, students, and business personnel. The advisory serves as a critical communication for this population, providing essential guidance on how to navigate the evolving situation.

Key recommendations outlined in the advisory include:

*   **Exercising Utmost Caution:** Prioritizing personal safety and being aware of surroundings at all times.
*   **Avoiding Unnecessary Travel:** Indian nationals are advised against non-essential movement within Iran, particularly to areas identified as potentially sensitive.
*   **Monitoring Local News and Official Announcements:** Staying informed through reliable local news sources and official communications from Iranian authorities and the Indian Embassy.
*   **Registering with the Embassy:** All Indian citizens in Iran, if not already registered, are strongly encouraged to register their details with the Embassy of India in Tehran. This enables the Embassy to reach out and provide assistance more effectively during emergencies.
*   **Document Readiness:** Keeping passports, visas, and other essential travel documents readily accessible in case of unforeseen circumstances.

A dedicated 24/7 helpline number has been made operational by the Indian Embassy in Tehran. This facility is intended to provide immediate assistance and address queries from Indian citizens and their families regarding the current situation and any emergency requirements. The Embassy has urged all registered and unregistered nationals to utilize this resource for timely support.

The situation in the wider Middle East remains fluid, with ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. Indian authorities continue to monitor developments closely and are prepared to issue further updates to the advisory should the situation warrant. Indian citizens in Iran are advised to maintain regular contact with the Indian Embassy for the latest guidance and support.
