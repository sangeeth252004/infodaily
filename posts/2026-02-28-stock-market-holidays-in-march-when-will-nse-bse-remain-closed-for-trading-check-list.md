Indian stock markets, including the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), are scheduled to observe multiple trading holidays during March 2024. These closures will affect various market segments, including equity, equity derivatives, and the security lending and borrowing (SLB) segments. Investors and traders are advised to take note of these non-trading days to manage their portfolios and trading strategies effectively.

The closures are in observance of public holidays recognized across India. During these declared holidays, all trading activities on both the NSE and BSE will remain suspended for the full day. This includes both the morning and evening sessions for specific segments where applicable. Settlement cycles for trades executed on preceding business days will also be adjusted accordingly, requiring participants to plan for potential delays in fund and security transfers.

The impact of these holidays extends beyond traditional equity markets. The currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives segments will also remain closed on the specified dates. Furthermore, commodity exchanges such as Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) will also typically observe similar holidays, though their schedules should be verified individually for any segment-specific variations, especially concerning evening trading sessions for commodities.

The official holiday calendar released by the exchanges provides specific dates for these non-trading days, ensuring transparency for all market participants. Understanding this schedule is crucial for domestic and international investors to avoid operational disruptions and ensure compliance with regulatory deadlines.

The stock market holidays scheduled for March 2024 are as follows:

*   **Monday, March 25, 2024 – Holi:**
    *   All segments of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), including Equity, Equity Derivatives, and SLB, will remain closed.
    *   The Currency Derivatives and Interest Rate Derivatives segments will also observe a full-day holiday.
    *   Trading on commodity exchanges like MCX and NCDEX will also be suspended for the full day.
    *   Trading will resume on Tuesday, March 26, 2024.

*   **Friday, March 29, 2024 – Good Friday:**
    *   All segments of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), comprising Equity, Equity Derivatives, and SLB, will be closed.
    *   The Currency Derivatives and Interest Rate Derivatives segments will also observe a full-day holiday.
    *   Commodity exchanges such as MCX and NCDEX will also remain closed for the entire trading day.
    *   Trading will resume on Monday, April 1, 2024, following the weekend.

Following these scheduled holidays, market operations will return to their regular trading hours on the next respective business day. Investors are encouraged to consult the official websites of the NSE and BSE for any last-minute updates or detailed circulars regarding market operations and settlement schedules. The next market holiday after March is typically observed in April, with specific dates varying based on the annual calendar of public and religious festivals.
