The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) officially released the results for the Chartered Accountancy (CA) Final examination for the year 2026 today, June 21, 2026. Candidates who appeared for the rigorous examination can now access and download their individual scorecards directly from the institute's designated online portals. This announcement marks a significant milestone for thousands of aspiring chartered accountants across India, culminating years of academic preparation and practical training.

The CA Final examination is the culminating stage of the Chartered Accountancy course, known for its challenging curriculum and stringent evaluation process. Success in this examination is a prerequisite for becoming a certified Chartered Accountant in India, allowing individuals to practice in various financial and accounting domains. The declaration of these results opens pathways for qualified professionals to contribute to the nation's economic landscape, working in auditing, taxation, financial management, and advisory roles within corporations, public sector undertakings, and private practices.

To maintain transparency and facilitate easy access, ICAI has made the results available on multiple official websites. Candidates are required to use their unique examination credentials to retrieve their scorecards. This typically includes their registration number along with either a four-digit PIN or their date of birth, as submitted during the application process. The digital scorecards provide a detailed breakdown of marks obtained in each paper, along with the overall aggregate.

For candidates to check and download their CA Final Result 2026, they should follow a specific procedure:

The results are provisional, and the ICAI typically provides a window for candidates to apply for verification of marks, should they have any discrepancies or concerns regarding their scores. This verification process ensures accuracy and addresses any potential errors. Further announcements regarding rank holders and the issuance of final mark sheets and pass certificates are expected to follow in due course.
