Tehran, Iran – Iranian authorities announced on Monday that the nation's interim government is fully operational and maintaining stability following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in a helicopter crash. Officials indicated that further announcements regarding the presidential succession process are anticipated within "a day or two," signaling adherence to constitutional procedures during this period of transition.

The confirmation aims to reassure both domestic and international audiences of governmental continuity amidst national mourning. First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber has assumed the role of interim president, a decision confirmed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Concurrently, Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani has been appointed as the interim foreign minister, stepping into the position previously held by Amirabdollahian.

Under Iran's constitution, a new presidential election must be organized within 50 days of the president's death. This swift constitutional requirement mandates an expedited process to select a permanent successor. The impending announcements are expected to detail the timeline, procedures, and potentially the committee responsible for overseeing these elections.

*   **Interim President:** Mohammad Mokhber, previously First Vice President.
*   **Interim Foreign Minister:** Ali Bagheri Kani, formerly Deputy Foreign Minister.
*   **Constitutional Mandate:** New presidential elections to be held within 50 days of the president's passing.
*   **Oversight:** Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retains ultimate authority over all major state affairs and has endorsed the interim appointments.

State media outlets have emphasized that government functions remain uninterrupted, with interim leaders promptly taking charge to ensure continuity across all sectors. This focus on maintaining administrative operations and stability is a key message from Iranian officials in the wake of the incident. The tragic deaths occurred on Sunday, May 19, 2024, when the helicopter carrying President Raisi and his delegation crashed in dense fog in Iran's East Azerbaijan province.

The coming days will be critical as Iranian authorities prepare to formally initiate the electoral process for a new president. The expected announcements will likely provide clarity on the election calendar and the participation requirements for candidates, setting the stage for a period of political activity as the nation moves towards selecting its next leader while continuing to observe a period of national mourning.
