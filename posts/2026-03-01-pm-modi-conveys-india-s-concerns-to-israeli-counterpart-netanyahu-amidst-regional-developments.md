Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on October 10, 2023, conveying India's "concerns over recent developments" in the region. The diplomatic exchange took place amidst a period of escalating conflict and heightened tensions in West Asia, days after the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israeli territory.

The conversation underscored India's active engagement in international diplomacy concerning regional stability. According to reports following the call, Prime Minister Modi reiterated India's consistent stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, while also emphasizing the importance of de-escalation. This diplomatic move reflects India's complex foreign policy approach, which seeks to balance strong bilateral ties with Israel alongside its historical support for the Palestinian cause and the welfare of the Palestinian people.

India's Ministry of External Affairs did not release specific details regarding the "recent developments" that were the subject of concern. However, the timing of the call, just three days after the initial large-scale attacks by Hamas and the subsequent Israeli military response, indicates a focus on the rapidly evolving security situation. India has historically advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has consistently called for a peaceful resolution through dialogue and negotiation. The conveyance of concerns by Prime Minister Modi signals India's deep interest in preventing a wider regional conflagration and mitigating humanitarian impacts.

*   **Key Discussions:** The call focused on the regional situation following the October 7 attacks.
*   **India's Stance:** Reiterated strong condemnation of terrorism and called for de-escalation.
*   **Bilateral Relations:** India and Israel maintain robust strategic partnership across defense, technology, and trade sectors.
*   **Humanitarian Focus:** India has consistently voiced the need for humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians in conflict zones.

India and Israel share a comprehensive strategic partnership, with high-level engagements frequently occurring across various sectors including defense, agriculture, and high-tech industries. This strong relationship has been a cornerstone of India's foreign policy in West Asia. However, India's broader diplomatic framework is characterized by its commitment to multilateralism, peaceful resolution of disputes, and maintaining cordial relations with all nations in the region, including Arab states. The call to Prime Minister Netanyahu highlights India's efforts to navigate these intricate geopolitical dynamics carefully.

Diplomatic channels between India and Israel are expected to remain active as the situation in West Asia evolves. India is likely to continue its engagement with regional and international partners, advocating for peace, stability, and humanitarian considerations. The government's consistent messaging reinforces India's position as a responsible global actor committed to fostering conditions for lasting peace and security through dialogue and diplomacy.
