Riyadh, Saudi Arabia – Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly urged top U.S. officials to authorize military action against Iran on multiple occasions following a series of regional attacks. These appeals, which reportedly occurred between 2019 and 2022, were detailed in a report by The Wall Street Journal, which cited accounts from current and former U.S. and Saudi officials. The Crown Prince's alleged pleas followed drone and missile attacks on critical infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and a U.S. military base in Iraq, which Riyadh and Washington attributed to Iran or its proxies.

According to The Wall Street Journal report, Crown Prince Mohammed viewed U.S. responses to the attacks as insufficient and sought a stronger deterrent against Iranian regional activities. The Saudi leader reportedly expressed concerns that a lack of forceful American retaliation would embolden Iran and further destabilize security across the Middle East.

Key incidents that prompted the reported appeals include:

*   **2019 Aramco Attacks:** Following the September 2019 drone and missile strikes on Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, which significantly impacted the kingdom's oil production, Crown Prince Mohammed reportedly pressed the Trump administration for a military response targeting Iran. While the U.S. did not launch direct military action, it deployed additional troops and air defense systems to Saudi Arabia.
*   **2021 Iraq Base Attack:** After a rocket attack on the Ain al-Assad airbase in Iraq in March 2021, which housed U.S. troops, the Crown Prince reportedly again urged the U.S. to take military action. The Biden administration, which had recently assumed office, reportedly emphasized diplomatic approaches and sanctions rather than military confrontation.

U.S. officials cited in The Wall Street Journal report indicated that they consistently resisted these calls for military action. Their reluctance was reportedly based on concerns about escalating a broader regional conflict and the complexities of direct military engagement while simultaneously pursuing indirect negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear program. Some U.S. officials reportedly described the Saudi Crown Prince's appeals as "frantic" and "almost begging" for American military intervention. Key U.S. officials reportedly involved in these discussions included then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.

The alleged appeals for military intervention highlight a divergence in strategic approaches between Saudi Arabia and the United States concerning Iranian regional influence. Saudi Arabia has consistently advocated for a more confrontational stance to curb perceived Iranian threats and activities. In contrast, both the Trump and Biden administrations have generally shown reluctance to engage in direct military conflict with Iran, opting for a strategy that includes economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and bolstering allies' defensive capabilities to manage regional tensions.

These reported discussions underscore the ongoing challenges in managing complex security dynamics in the Middle East. As diplomatic efforts surrounding Iran's nuclear program continue and regional proxy conflicts persist, the differing perspectives on how to counter perceived Iranian threats remain a central aspect of U.S.-Saudi relations and broader Middle Eastern policy. The future trajectory of these interactions is expected to continue shaping regional stability.
