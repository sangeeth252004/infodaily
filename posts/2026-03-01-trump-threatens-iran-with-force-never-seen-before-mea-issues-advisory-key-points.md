WASHINGTON D.C./NEW DELHI — Former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to Iran on June 24, 2019, stating that any aggression from Tehran would be met with "force never seen before." The pronouncement, delivered via social media, intensified existing geopolitical tensions in the Persian Gulf region. In response to the escalating security situation, India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) promptly issued a comprehensive travel advisory urging its citizens to exercise caution in specific areas of the Middle East.

President Trump's statement followed a period of heightened friction between Washington and Tehran, which included attacks on international oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman and the downing of a U.S. surveillance drone by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. In his message, President Trump asserted that the United States was prepared to defend its interests and personnel, emphasizing that any conflict would signify the "official end of Iran." The rhetoric marked a significant escalation in the ongoing standoff, drawing immediate attention from global powers and international bodies. U.S. officials indicated that the administration's posture was a deterrent against perceived Iranian provocations, aiming to safeguard freedom of navigation and regional stability.

*   **Context of Threat:** The warning came amid a series of incidents, including suspected limpet mine attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman on June 13, 2019, and the shooting down of a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk drone over the Strait of Hormuz on June 20, 2019.
*   **U.S. Stance:** The Trump administration consistently reiterated its commitment to protecting U.S. assets and allies, while also calling for international cooperation to address Iran's regional activities and nuclear program.
*   **International Reactions:** The statement prompted calls for de-escalation from several European nations and the United Nations, with concerns raised over the potential for miscalculation and wider regional conflict.

Concurrently, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs took proactive steps to ensure the safety and security of its large diaspora residing and working across the Middle East. The advisory, issued on the same day, specifically urged Indian nationals to avoid all non-essential travel to the region. For those already present, the MEA recommended exercising utmost vigilance and avoiding areas of potential conflict or unrest.

*   **Advisory Details:** The MEA advised Indian citizens to remain in regular contact with the Indian Embassy or Consulate in their respective countries. It also provided emergency contact numbers and requested individuals to register their presence with the missions.
*   **Rationale:** The advisory cited the "evolving security situation" in the Middle East as the primary reason, underscoring the government's priority for the well-being of its citizens abroad. India maintains significant economic and strategic interests in the Gulf region, making the safety of its expatriate community a critical concern.
*   **Impact on Citizens:** The advisory highlighted the potential risks to Indian workers and professionals, many of whom are employed in vital sectors across Gulf nations. It called for adherence to local safety guidelines and continuous monitoring of news reports.

The developments underscore the volatile geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. As international efforts continued to focus on diplomatic resolution and de-escalation, global observers remained watchful of further actions from both the United States and Iran, and the subsequent implications for regional and global security. India's advisory served as a practical measure to mitigate risks for its citizens amidst ongoing tensions.
