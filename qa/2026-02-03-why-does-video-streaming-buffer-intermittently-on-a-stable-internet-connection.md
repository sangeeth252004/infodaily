question: "Why does video streaming buffer intermittently on a stable internet connection?"
answer: "Video streaming can buffer on a stable internet connection due to factors beyond the connection's raw speed. These can include congestion on the server's end, limitations in the device's processing power, or issues within the user's local network. Even with a consistently fast internet link, bottlenecks elsewhere in the data delivery path can cause interruptions."

### Network Congestion

While your individual internet connection might be stable, the path data takes from the streaming server to your device can experience congestion. This is similar to traffic jams on a highway. If many users are accessing the same server simultaneously, or if intermediate network points are overloaded, data packets can be delayed, leading to buffering.

### Server-Side Limitations

The streaming service's servers have a finite capacity for sending out video data. If the demand for a particular video exceeds the server's ability to deliver it quickly enough to all requesting users, buffering can occur. This is more likely during peak viewing times.

### Device Performance

The device you are using to stream (e.g., a smart TV, computer, or smartphone) has its own processing capabilities. If the device is running many applications, has insufficient RAM, or its processor is struggling to decode the video stream in real-time, it can fall behind in processing the incoming data, resulting in buffering.

### Local Network Issues

Even with a stable internet connection coming into your home, issues within your home network can cause buffering. This includes an overloaded Wi-Fi router, interference from other devices, or too many devices simultaneously consuming bandwidth on your home network. For example, if multiple people are downloading large files, gaming online, and streaming video simultaneously on the same Wi-Fi network, the router may struggle to manage the traffic efficiently.

### Video Quality and Encoding

Higher resolution videos (like 4K) require more data and processing power. If your device or local network is not sufficiently powerful to handle the higher bitrate and complexity of such streams, it might buffer, even on a good internet connection. Additionally, the efficiency of the video encoding used by the streaming service can play a role.
