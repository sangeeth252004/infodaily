### Risks Associated with Unknown Download Sources

When software is offered for free on websites that are not well-known or officially affiliated with the developer, there is a high probability that the files have been tampered with. These modifications can introduce malicious code designed to harm your system or steal your information.

#### Types of Malware

*   **Viruses:** Software that can replicate itself and spread to other computers, often causing system damage or data loss.
*   **Spyware:** Programs that secretly monitor your activity, collect personal information, and transmit it to third parties.
*   **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom payment for their decryption.
*   **Adware:** Software that displays unwanted advertisements, often aggressively and persistently.

#### Examples of Risks

Imagine downloading a seemingly free video editing tool from a small, obscure website. Upon installation, your computer might start displaying pop-up ads that are impossible to close, or you may notice your personal files becoming inaccessible with a message demanding payment. This is a common scenario with malware hidden within unauthorized software downloads.

#### Edge Cases and Limitations

While the majority of software from unknown sites is risky, there might be rare instances where a legitimate, independent developer shares their work on a less prominent platform. However, verifying the authenticity and safety of such software is extremely difficult for the average user. It's still a gamble compared to using established channels.
