question: "Why does my internet connection slow down when many devices use it?"
answer: "When multiple devices share an internet connection, each device requests and receives data. If the total demand for data exceeds the capacity of the internet service, the connection will slow down for all devices as they compete for available bandwidth. This is similar to multiple cars trying to drive through a single lane on a highway."

### Bandwidth Limitations

Your internet connection has a finite amount of bandwidth, which is the maximum rate at which data can be transferred. Think of bandwidth as the width of a pipe; a wider pipe can carry more water at once. When you have many devices active, each device is trying to send and receive data, consuming a portion of that available bandwidth.

### Shared Resources

Most home internet connections are shared. Even if you have a fast connection, when numerous devices are performing data-intensive tasks simultaneously, the total demand can exceed the provider's allocated capacity for your service. Activities like streaming high-definition video, downloading large files, or playing online games require significant bandwidth.

### Network Congestion

When many devices are actively using the internet, your home network can become congested. Your router, which manages the traffic between your devices and the internet, has processing limits. If it's overwhelmed with too many requests at once, it can slow down the distribution of data to each device.

**Example:** Imagine a household where one person is streaming a 4K movie (which uses a lot of bandwidth), another is downloading a large software update, and a third is on a video call. All these activities compete for the same internet bandwidth. If the internet plan's speed isn't high enough to support all these simultaneously, the connection will feel sluggish for everyone.

### Edge Cases

Some routers have Quality of Service (QoS) settings that allow you to prioritize certain devices or applications. This can help manage congestion by giving more bandwidth to critical tasks. However, even with QoS, if the total demand consistently exceeds the available bandwidth, speeds will still decrease. Additionally, the type of connection (e.g., DSL, cable, fiber optic) significantly impacts the base bandwidth available, influencing how noticeable slowdowns are with multiple devices.
