### Understanding Public Wi-Fi Risks

Public Wi-Fi networks, found in places like coffee shops, airports, and libraries, are designed for broad accessibility. However, this open nature often means they lack the robust security measures found in private networks. This makes them susceptible to various cyber threats.

### Common Threats on Public Wi-Fi

*   **Packet Sniffing:** This is a technique where attackers intercept data packets transmitted over a network. If you are using an unencrypted website or entering sensitive information, an attacker on the same public Wi-Fi could capture your login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal details.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** In a MitM attack, an attacker positions themselves between your device and the internet connection. They can then monitor, alter, or even steal the data you are sending and receiving without your knowledge.
*   **Evil Twin Hotspots:** Attackers can set up fake Wi-Fi hotspots with names similar to legitimate ones (e.g., "Free_Airport_Wi-Fi" instead of "Airport_Wi-Fi"). If you connect to such a network, all your traffic will be routed through the attacker's system.

### Examples of Vulnerable Transactions

When conducting online shopping on an unsecured public Wi-Fi, details such as:
*   Your login username and password for shopping sites.
*   Your credit card number, expiration date, and CVV code.
*   Your billing and shipping addresses.

can potentially be compromised.

### Mitigating Risks

While it's best to avoid online shopping on public Wi-Fi, if you must, consider these precautions:
*   **Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):** A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it.
*   **Ensure Websites Use HTTPS:** Look for "https://" at the beginning of the website address and a padlock icon in your browser's address bar. This indicates that the connection to the website is encrypted. However, even with HTTPS, a VPN offers an additional layer of security.
*   **Avoid Sensitive Transactions:** Refrain from making purchases or accessing financial accounts on public networks.
*   **Keep Software Updated:** Ensure your operating system, browser, and security software are up-to-date with the latest patches.

### Limitations and Edge Cases

Even with HTTPS, some vulnerabilities can exist. Sophisticated attacks might still pose a risk. Furthermore, if your device itself has been compromised with malware, sensitive data could be at risk regardless of the network used. It is always best to use trusted, private networks for financial transactions.
