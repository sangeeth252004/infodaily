## Overview

Coursera and Udemy are online learning platforms offering a wide array of courses from various institutions and instructors, differing in their educational focus and content delivery.

## Key Differences

Udemy courses are typically more self-paced, project-oriented, and focus on immediate skill acquisition, with completion certificates often less formal.
